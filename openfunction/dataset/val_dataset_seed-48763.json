If you set it to PATH , the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it LOGICAL , you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.\nPossible values:\n\nPATH\nLOGICAL\n3. home_directory_mappings - Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target . This value can be set only when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL .\nThe following is an Entry and Target pair example.\n\n[ { \"Entry\": \"/directory1\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]\nIn most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory (âchroot â). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value.\nThe following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .\n\n[ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]\n(structure)\n\nRepresents an object that contains entries and targets for HomeDirectoryMappings .\nThe following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot .\n\n[ { \"Entry\": \"/\", \"Target\": \"/bucket_name/home/mydirectory\" } ]\nEntry -> (string)\n\nRepresents an entry for HomeDirectoryMappings .\nTarget -> (string)\n\nRepresents the map target that is used in a HomeDirectorymapEntry .\n4. policy - A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a userâs access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName} , ${Transfer:HomeDirectory} , and ${Transfer:HomeBucket} .\n\nNoteThis policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies.\nFor session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument.\nFor an example of a session policy, see Example session policy .\nFor more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web ServicesSecurity Token Service API Reference .\n5. posix_profile - The full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid ), group ID (Gid ), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids ), that controls your usersâ access to your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your file system determine the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.\nUid -> (long)\n\nThe POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.\nGid -> (long)\n\nThe POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.\nSecondaryGids -> (list)\n\nThe secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by this user.\n(long)\n6. role - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls your usersâ access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your usersâ transfer requests.\n7. server_id - A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance. This is the specific server that you added your user to.\n8. external_id - A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within your directory. The users of the group that you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows PowerShell.\n\nGet-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like \"*YourGroupName* *\"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid\nIn that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your Active Directory group.\nThe regular expression used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces.

You can then configure AWS WAF to reject those requests.Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateRegexMatchSet request.See also: AWS API Documentation\n\nParameters:\n1. regex_match_set_id - The RegexMatchSetId of the  RegexMatchSet that you want to update. RegexMatchSetId is returned by  CreateRegexMatchSet and by  ListRegexMatchSets .\n2. updates - An array of RegexMatchSetUpdate objects that you want to insert into or delete from a  RegexMatchSet . For more information, see  RegexMatchTuple .\n(structure)\n\n\nNoteThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nIn an  UpdateRegexMatchSet request, RegexMatchSetUpdate specifies whether to insert or delete a  RegexMatchTuple and includes the settings for the RegexMatchTuple .\nAction -> (string)\n\nSpecifies whether to insert or delete a  RegexMatchTuple .\nRegexMatchTuple -> (structure)\n\nInformation about the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect and the identifier of the regular expression (regex) pattern that you want AWS WAF to search for. If you specify DELETE for the value of Action , the RegexMatchTuple values must exactly match the values in the RegexMatchTuple that you want to delete from the RegexMatchSet .\nFieldToMatch -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies where in a web request to look for the RegexPatternSet .\nType -> (string)\n\nThe part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts of a request that you can search include the following:\n\nHEADER : A specified request header, for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header. If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\n\nData -> (string)\n\nWhen the value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is not case sensitive.\nWhen the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter name is not case sensitive.\nIf the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .\n\n\nTextTransformation -> (string)\n\nText transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on RegexPatternSet before inspecting a request for a match.\nYou can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.\n\nCMD_LINE\nWhen youâre concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system commandline command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:\n\nDelete the following characters: â â ^\nDelete spaces before the following characters: / (\nReplace the following characters with a space: , ;\nReplace multiple spaces with one space\nConvert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\nUse this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):\n\nf, formfeed, decimal 12\nt, tab, decimal 9\nn, newline, decimal 10\nr, carriage return, decimal 13\nv, vertical tab, decimal 11\nnon-breaking space, decimal 160\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.\nHTML_ENTITY_DECODE\n\nUse this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:\n\nReplaces (ampersand)quot; with \"\nReplaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160\nReplaces (ampersand)lt; with a âless thanâ symbol\nReplaces (ampersand)gt; with >\nReplaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the corresponding characters\nReplaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the corresponding characters\n\n\nLOWERCASE\nUse this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).\n\nURL_DECODE\nUse this option to decode a URL-encoded value.\n\nNONE\nSpecify NONE if you donât want to perform any text transformations.\n\nRegexPatternSetId -> (string)\n\nThe RegexPatternSetId for a RegexPatternSet . You use RegexPatternSetId to get information about a RegexPatternSet (see  GetRegexPatternSet ), update a RegexPatternSet (see  UpdateRegexPatternSet ), insert a RegexPatternSet into a RegexMatchSet or delete one from a RegexMatchSet (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet ), and delete an RegexPatternSet from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRegexPatternSet ).\n\nRegexPatternSetId is returned by  CreateRegexPatternSet and by  ListRegexPatternSets .\n3. change_token - The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",
