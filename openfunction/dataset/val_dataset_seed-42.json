AppConfig supports the following growth types:\n\nLinear : For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by increments of the growth factor evenly distributed over the deployment time. For example, a linear deployment that uses a growth factor of 20 initially makes the configuration available to 20 percent of the targets. After 1/5th of the deployment time has passed, the system updates the percentage to 40 percent. This continues until 100% of the targets are set to receive the deployed configuration.\nExponential : For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment exponentially using the following formula: G*(2^N) . In this formula, G is the growth factor specified by the user and N is the number of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as follows:\n2*(2^0)\n2*(2^1)\n2*(2^2)\n\nExpressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the configuration has been deployed to all targets.\nPossible values:\n\nLINEAR\nEXPONENTIAL\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using  ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup . Once youâve created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using  ModifyDBCluster . When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running DB cluster, you need to reboot the DB instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect.WarningAfter you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon Neptune to fully complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the character_set_database parameter. You can use the Parameter Groups option of the Amazon Neptune console or the  DescribeDBClusterParameters command to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.\nParameters:\n1. db_cluster_parameter_group_name - The name of the DB cluster parameter group.\nConstraints:\n\nMust match the name of an existing DBClusterParameterGroup.\n\n\nNoteThis value is stored as a lowercase string.\n2. db_parameter_group_family - The DB cluster parameter group family name. A DB cluster parameter group can be associated with one and only one DB cluster parameter group family, and can be applied only to a DB cluster running a database engine and engine version compatible with that DB cluster parameter group family.\n3. description - The description for the DB cluster parameter group.\n4. tags - The tags to be assigned to the new DB cluster parameter group.\n(structure)\n\nMetadata assigned to an Amazon Neptune resource consisting of a key-value pair.\nKey -> (string)\n\nA key is the required name of the tag.

For information about creating an SMB location, see Creating a location for SMB .\nParameters:\n1. location_arn - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SMB location to update.\n2. subdirectory - The subdirectory in the SMB file system that is used to read data from the SMB source location or write data to the SMB destination. The SMB path should be a path thatâs exported by the SMB server, or a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be mounted by other SMB clients in your network.\n\nNoteSubdirectory must be specified with forward slashes. For example, /path/to/folder .\nTo transfer all the data in the folder that you specified, DataSync must have permissions to mount the SMB share and to access all the data in that share. To ensure this, do either of the following:\n\nEnsure that the user/password specified belongs to the user who can mount the share and who has the appropriate permissions for all of the files and directories that you want DataSync to access.\nUse credentials of a member of the Backup Operators group to mount the share.\n\nDoing either of these options enables the agent to access the data. For the agent to access directories, you must also enable all execute access.\n3. user - The user who can mount the share has the permissions to access files and folders in the SMB share.\n4. domain - The name of the Windows domain that the SMB server belongs to.\n5. password - The password of the user who can mount the share has the permissions to access files and folders in the SMB share.\n6. agent_arns - The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for a Simple Message Block (SMB) location.\n(string)\n7. mount_options - Specifies the version of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol that DataSync uses to access an SMB file server.\nVersion -> (string)\n\nBy default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol version based on negotiation with your SMB file server. You also can configure DataSync to use a specific SMB version, but we recommend doing this only if DataSync has trouble negotiating with the SMB file server automatically.\nThese are the following options for configuring the SMB version:\n\nAUTOMATIC (default): DataSync and the SMB file server negotiate the highest version of SMB that they mutually support between 2.1 and 3.1.1. This is the recommended option. If you instead choose a specific version that your file server doesnât support, you may get an Operation Not Supported error.\nSMB3 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 3.0.2.\nSMB2 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.1.\nSMB2_0 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.0.\nSMB1 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 1.0.\n\n\nNoteThe SMB1 option isnât available when creating an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP location .\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",

App Runner requires this resource when you create or update App Runner services and you require non-default auto scaling settings. You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services.Configure a higher MinSize to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region. The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost.See also: AWS API Documentation\n\nParameters:\n1. auto_scaling_configuration_name - A name for the auto scaling configuration. When you use it for the first time in an Amazon Web Services Region, App Runner creates revision number 1 of this name. When you use the same name in subsequent calls, App Runner creates incremental revisions of the configuration.\n\nNoteThe name DefaultConfiguration is reserved (itâs the configuration that App Runner uses if you donât provide a custome one). You canât use it to create a new auto scaling configuration, and you canât create a revision of it.\nWhen you want to use your own auto scaling configuration for your App Runner service, create a configuration with a different name , and then provide it when you create or update your service.\n2. max_concurrency - The maximum number of concurrent requests that you want an instance to process. If the number of concurrent requests exceeds this limit, App Runner scales up your service.\nDefault: 100\n3. min_size - The minimum number of instances that App Runner provisions for your service. The service always has at least MinSize provisioned instances. Some of them actively serve traffic. The rest of them (provisioned and inactive instances) are a cost-effective compute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You pay for memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay for CPU usage of only the active subset.\nApp Runner temporarily doubles the number of provisioned instances during deployments, to maintain the same capacity for both old and new code.\nDefault: 1\n4. max_size - The maximum number of instances that your service scales up to. At most MaxSize instances actively serve traffic for your service.\nDefault: 25\n5. tags - A list of metadata items that you can associate with your auto scaling configuration resource. A tag is a key-value pair.\n(structure)\n\nDescribes a tag that is applied to an App Runner resource. A tag is a metadata item consisting of a key-value pair.\nKey -> (string)\n\nThe key of the tag.\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe value of the tag.\nFormat your response as a single string using keyword arguments.",
