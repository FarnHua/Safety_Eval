For this operation, you canât use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you canât grant IAM permissions in policies. For more information about authorization models in Amazon Cognito, see Using the Amazon Cognito native and OIDC APIs .NoteThis action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with Amazon Pinpoint . Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.\nParameters:\n1. access_token - A non-expired access token for the user whose attribute verification code you want to generate.\n2. attribute_name - The attribute name returned by the server response to get the user attribute verification code.\n3. client_metadata - A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.\nYou create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the GetUserAttributeVerificationCode API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the custom message trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your GetUserAttributeVerificationCode request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.\nFor more information, see Customizing user pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .\n\nNoteWhen you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon Cognito wonât do the following:\n\nStore the ClientMetadata value.

The activation process also associates your gateway with your account. For more information, see  UpdateGatewayInformation .NoteYou must turn on the gateway VM before you can activate your gateway.\nParameters:\n1. activation_key - Your gateway activation key. You can obtain the activation key by sending an HTTP GET request with redirects enabled to the gateway IP address (port 80). The redirect URL returned in the response provides you the activation key for your gateway in the query string parameter activationKey .

However, this type of managed permission is visible to only the resource share owner, and the associated resource share canât be modified by using RAM.Before you use  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy , you should first run this operation to ensure that you have an appropriate customer managed permission that can be associated with the promoted resource share.NoteYou canât modify a CREATED_FROM_POLICY resource share so you canât associate the new customer managed permission by using ReplacePermsissionAssociations . However, if you use  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy , that operation automatically associates the fully manageable customer managed permission to the newly promoted STANDARD resource share.See also: AWS API Documentation\n\nParameters:\n1. permission_arn - Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CREATED_FROM_POLICY permission that you want to promote.
