Avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected site. 5.

As per your complaint in case if you have a recent history of throat infection and even if it is coming back also presently then there is a possibility that the swollen lymph nodes are due to Reactionary Lymphadinitis, and it is not a serious condition and when you will take medication for treating the infection like antibiotics the swollen lymph nodes will resolve gradually. You should consult an Otolaryngologies and get evaluated and get tested for bacterial infection [rapid strep test] and viral infection [rapid mono test] to rule out the exact cause of infection and treatment can be planned accordingly. If there are recurring episodes of the same then Tonsillectomy will only provide permanent relief. As of now do alternate warm and cool compresses over the lymph nodes. Hope this information helps.

        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. A single hair growing on a mole with no other change in appearance is less likely to be a cancer. However, it will help to see the mole clinically and then make a confirmation. The size and growth of the mole in recent times is also important. If it is a small mole then I suggest you closely observe the mole by either asking your relative to check it every 3 months or take a picture and compare each time to see any changes in appearance. For larger moles it is better to consult a dermatologist and take a clinical opinion and if required a skin biopsy from the mole. This is a painless procedure and done to look for cells in the mole with signs of cancer. You can also get your mole removed completely by getting radiofrequency ablation sessions. This requires few sessions and is a permanent procedure done by the dermatologist. Please do not worry."

        "answer_icliniq": "Hi Doris Welcome to Chat Doctor As you told you have PCs and one fallopian tube is also blocked. PCs is a common problem among women which leads to infertility. Every month only one egg comes out of the ovary and available for fertilization, but you can't predict which side ovary will ovulate. As you told one side tube is blocked and if ovulation occurs that side only then chances of pregnancy will be very low. You need to undergo follicular monitoring (By ultrasound) to see growth of egg and side of ovulation. If ovulation is occurring from favorable side then there is chance of pregnancy. As you have PCs I would suggest you to undergo certain hormonal tests like LH, FSH, Testosterone, RHEAS (Also s.prolactin n TSH) etc. And if there is disturbance of hormones then it needs to be treated accordingly. You have not mentioned your age and weight. I would suggest you to lose weight if you are overweight by diet control and exercise. Get your blood sugar checked as it also has adverse effect on fertility. M2 tone and folic acid can be continued. You need to take tab camphene to induce ovulation, do follicular monitoring to see growth of egg and side of ovulation and then try by timed intercourse or GUI. Take care"

However my biggest problem is my balance.... Although I have recovered and come along way from my stroke physically, my balance has become worse causing a lot of dangerous falls.  It is not dizziness it is Balance, have gone to eye doctors & earing testing. this balance problem renders me walking as if I have consumed a lot of alcohol, which I do not drink even socially. is it just something I must learn to live with or could there be help out their anywhere? I would so appreciate your feedback or any suggestions you could offer?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I am glad to know that you have made a remarkable recovery from the disabling stroke that you suffered earlier, and are able to perform most of your daily activities. Botox is very helpful in relieving spasticity after stroke, and relieving pain due to spasticity. Based on the location of blood clot in your stroke, we do not expect significant imbalance in your case. Imbalance is often seen in cases of stroke affecting the cerebellum or its connections (located at the back of brain). So, I would be interested in seeing your latest MRI brain report. Regarding treatment for imbalance, some medications such as amantadine may help, but much of recovery would depend on physiotherapy and rehabilitation. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. "

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Anyone who has unprotected sex is at risk for pregnancy. However, many women can also experience irregular cycles and hormonal imbalances after discontinuing Depo-Provera. Some women do not resume normal monthly cycles or ovulation for even up to year. So it can be difficult to rule out pregnancy if you have irregular cycles after taking Depo-Provera. Unfortunately, pregnancy related symptoms can vary widely between women and actually most women do not have any symptoms of pregnancy at all before a missed menstrual period. Furthermore, many women experience psychological symptoms of pregnancy due to unconscious fears or desires. So I would suggest that you do a urine pregnancy test, so that you know for sure what is going on. If you do not desire pregnancy, I would suggest that you select an alternative method of contraception because even if women do not get periods regularly they still can be at risk for pregnancy. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes, "

Additionally, I don't know what your blood pressure is and if you have any signs of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy that is associated with elevated blood pressure, protein in your urine, elevated liver enzymes (HELP), and other bio marker abnormalities.

        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, How old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. When a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. Mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. The apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more.  Most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. I agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped.  No persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment.  She will eat when she wishes. Place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family.  The food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants.  Encourage holding and Chat Doctor.  Allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. If she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal.  If she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. She will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. A small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. Parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. A child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. As long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. Allow her to feed herself as much as possible. As soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. She needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided.  Normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. Naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. When parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

Hi, my question is that I alway have my period rite but this month When I got my period for 3days I was spotting ant then for 5days I was bleeding and then I had sex with my husband but We didn t use protection can I still get pregnant?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hallow Dear, The 3 days spotting you had been premenstrual spotting. The menstruation is to be counted from the day you have normal bleeding for 5 days. If immediately after that you had intercourse with your husband, there is the most remote possibility (practically no possibility) of pregnancy. The egg gets released 14 days prior to the next expected menstruation. The egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Therefore, a period of about a week around the day of egg release is the Fertile Window. Your intercourse was far away from this period. So the chances of pregnancy are almost nil. Hope this helps you,"

Having a thorough clinical musculoskeletal examination followed by an MRI of the knee will help understand the soft tissues better. Also, your age is 80, so some degenerative changes in the joint can be expected on general physiology. Having a physical therapy for a few sessions should help reduce the pain and improve the mobility as well. With therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy the pain will be reduced and inflammation as well. Performing some simple knee strengthening exercises will help stabilize the joint and safeguard it from future injuries. In my clinical practice most geriatric cases respond well to physical therapy.

I visited the Dr and Opth. last Thur and while the Dr was a bit concerned about Shingles, the Opth. didnt think it was a herpes virus.  He preferred to just wait it out.  But it seems to be worsening, not improving.  Thoughts?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, I can understand your concern for itchy right eye with rashes on same side on bridge of nose. The history provided is too brief, but I can make a probable diagnosis of Herpes zoster or shingles. Its sudden appearance, pain, deep redness and further one-sided appearance in 4-5 days of period. It is not unusual to find such kind of picture in zoster with red areas and pain present on one side of body not crossing the mid-line. I suggest you to take a painkiller tablet such as paracetamol by mouth for two times a day after meals. This will reduce the pain intensity and if pain persists then you can take it for 3 times at a gap of 8 hours. For the itching part antihistamine tablet such as Loratadine (Clarity or forfeits) would be most appropriate to be taken in the same manner as for paracetamol. Oral antiviral may be required such as acyclovir for best coverage of the problem. If your symptoms are not matching above then you need to take second opinion and accordingly go for the investigations suggested by the doctor. Take care."

When pathologic, they could be intention tremors, which set in only when one has to take something or resting tremors. Depending on the particular characteristics of the tremors and the age, the diagnosis becomes very different. The sensation you are feeling like pins is generally called a peripheral neuropathy.

Still have some pain lower left jaw and left ear and down left side of neck pain changes from mild to wow that realy hurts. wondering if only a tooth problem or more",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern... As per your complaint and presentation of symptoms if you have got a tooth extracted then pain after 2 days is not an abnormal finding and if the pain is due to extraction then it will gradually resolve as the healing will proceed considerably. But in your case if the pain is progressively increased and the area to which the pain is radiating that is lower left jaw, left ear and side of neck it seems that there is some disorder related to the jaw joint known as TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT and such a disorder is known as TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT DISORDER. I would suggest you to wait for one week so that the healing of the extraction socket takes place so that the exact cause can be ruled out as if pain subsides after healing then it is due to the extraction socket. In case if still the pain continues then you will have to consult an oral physician and get evaluated and get a full mouth x-ray known as ORTHOPANTOMOGRAM [OPG] done so that he can evaluate the condition of the jaw joints and make a confirmatory diagnosis. As of now you can take anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen and muscle relaxant like Chlorzoxasone for relief. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. ."

Recently my legs have started to swell at calves during the day and if I take rest and place my legs higher than my body while sleeping it becomes normal. I have a slight discomfort around my right kidney but no pain. I also have a fatty lever problem also. Kindly tell me what should I do to rduce the swelling and how can I normalize my fatty lever?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. The swelling in the calf regions during periods of activity can mean decreased venous return and pooling of blood. This is not related to your right kidney stone. There are arteries which supply blood to the different regions including limbs and veins which bring back the blood to the heart. The veins have valves at some places to prevent back flow and allow the blood to reach the heart. In some people which progressing and in those doing standing jobs there is malfunctioning of the venous valves and the blood gets pooled in the lower limbs. This opens up connecting channels between veins called perforators and that causes varicose veins which is tortuous superficial veins in the lower limbs. It is suggested that you consult a doctor and discuss the probability of varicose veins and if required get a venous Doppler of lower limbs done. For the right kidney discomfort please get the ultrasound scan done again to know of any dislodgement of the stone which can cause the discomfort. If the stone is not showing Andy increase in size and is in place then nothing needs to be done. There are many causes of liver showing fatty changes (i) Increased intake of fatty foods and alcohol(ii) Over weight and obese patients.(iii) Those who have fatty liver running in family members.(iv) Any liver condition that is changing appearance of liver.(v) Mild fatty liver can also be there in many normal people can get your liver function test and lipid profile done to know if the liver enzymes are raised and cholesterol numbers are increased. Please discuss results with your doctor and take required treatment if your tests results are higher than normal. Please do not worry."

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello Sir, Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns. Based on the reports, you do have diabetes. For good glucose control your HBA1C should be less than 6.5%, your fasting blood glucose should be less than 110 mg/do and your 2 post meal glucose should be less than 160-170 mg /DL (provided you are fit and fine and do not have any other debilitating illnesses). I am not sure of your age. As your sugar levels are borderline you could try 3 month trial of diet and exercise alone to control your glucose levels. After 3 months measure the blood tests again. If they have reduced then you can continue the same healthy lifestyle changes and keep checking your blood glucose levels every 3 months. If your blood glucose levels have not changed or have worsened after the 3-month trial of diet and exercise then you need to start medication along with your lifestyle changes. Healthy lifestyle tips:1) Exercise-moderate exercise like brisk walking, cycling, swimming etc. - for at least 45-60 min every day or at least 5 out of 7 days in a week.2) Diet: Avoid sugary food items and sweets, cookies, chocolates etc. take plenty of vegetables (restrict potatoes). Take whole grains products like wheat bread, oats, millets, brown rice etc. Avoid refined /plain flour items. You can take 2-3 servings of fruit(avoid mango, jack fruit, custard apple, chick). Take adequate protein (eggs, pulses, non veg- but restrict mutton). Can take 5-7 nuts like almonds, cashew nuts etc. Restrict saturated fats like butter, cheese, paneer etc. 3) Reduce weight if you are overweight. I wish you well. I hope this answer has been helpful to you. Regards Chat Doctor. "

        "answer_icliniq": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. At present, you are mostly having old, healed, fibrotic lesion on chest x-ray. After six months of treatment, active tb lesions on chest x-ray heal. Healing takes place mostly in the form of fibrosis, calcification or both (fire calcification). Complete resolution is rare in tuberculosis. So these healed areas appear as scar lesion on chest x-ray. They will be seen as it is for lifetime. So presence of this fibrotic lesion is not suggestive of tuberculosis. Your sputum report is also negative. So you are mostly having healed lesion and not having active tb lesion. But if you really want to rule out active tuberculosis then get done CT thorax and bronchoscopy with BAD (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. If both these are negative for TB then you are not having active tuberculosis fir sure. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

Get an Orthopaedician consult, and your Doctor may advise you for X-ray or MRI as necessary to find the cause. If you have a pinched nerve, you could get other forms of pain management like Epidural steroid injection as advised by your Doctor.

In the left kidney, there are also at least approximately 5 calculi with the largest measuring 5mm. No uretic calculus is detected and there is no hydroureter or hydronephrosis.I had a recent X-ray which did not show any kidney stones on the right side, which was why the urologist ordered the recent CT scan. I was on a waiting list to have ESWL. Do you think it will still be necessary?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, The treatment of kidney stone depends on your symptoms, size and location. Asymptomatic calculi, less than or equal to 5 mm can usually be managed by medical therapy (e.g. potassium citrate syrup, Eurostat, thiamine etc.).  ESL is good for a single stone between size 5 to 10 mm. Since shockwaves have to pass through the kidney to break the stones, there is a limit to the number of shockwaves that a kidney can tolerate. Moreover, small stones are difficult to localize in fluoroscopy or ultrasound during ESL. Thus, ESL is a very poor choice for multiple small stones.  For multiple small stones, current treatment of choice is flexible ureteroscopy with laser. In this procedure, the surgeon can see inside the kidney and treat each and every stone with laser. Thus, clearance rates are very good. However, its availability is limited to a few centers.  In your case, if you do not have any symptoms, I advise you to start medical therapy after undergoing a 24-hour urine metabolic work up (Check urine volume, pH, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, uric acid, oxalate, citrate and magnesium) along with serum creatinine, calcium, uric acid and electrolytes. These tests will help to find out the reason for formation of kidney stones. Accordingly, individualized medical therapy can be advised to dissolve current stones and prevent future stones.  General measures to treat kidney stones are to keep urine output more than 2.5 liters per day, reduce salt intake less than 5 g/day and reduce animal protein intake.  I hope I have answered your query. If you need any clarification, please feel free to contact me. Wish you good health, Warm regards,"

Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F.

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello dear, Regarding the problem of Erectile dysfunction, it is due to decreased blood supply to the penis. Though medications like Calls & Viagra increase blood flow to penis & maintains erection, it can be improved by having a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts & honey. Connections between erectile dysfunction & excess use of porn has been reported in many studies. For those affected, recovery takes place by 6-12 weeks & mainly involves avoiding the causative factor, that is watching porn. Avoid stress...practice meditation. Avoid smoking & alcohol. Despite these measures, if you experience difficulty, it will be better to rule out other causes like high blood pressure, blood sugar and other local causes that impair blood flow to the genital organ. Wishing you a Healthy Life. Take care."

        "input": "Hi, I fell down a flight of stairs during the summer, and got a giant bruise on my left butt cheek. I went to the doctors and he gave me something for the pain, and the bruise healed surprisingly quickly. Now, the bruise has been gone for months (almost a year), but I still have a hard lump that s a bit smaller than an egg on my butt. I was told that it would go away, or at least get smaller, but it hasn t. I m feeling very self consious now because my butt is lopsided, and so I haven t been able to wear some things I would like because I m afraid someone will notice. Is there any way to make it go away? Some more information, the bump hurts sometimes, not often, but it does get sore. Also it s kind of far from the surface so it s a bit harder to feel unless you really press down. Please, don t rush to answer because I m sure there are way more serious problems here than mine, but I appreciate the answer when you do get back. Thank you.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi! This is very common and please don't worry about this! Often I come across such cases of post-injury bumps here and there on peoples bodies and get few things to learn every time:1. These are old organized hematoma often gets calcification within them so that the swelling doesn't disappear, rather it hardens!2. It can get infected in case of any kind of manipulation resulting in an abscess3. Often these are forgotten, and only some complication reminds of it4. Underlying bone fracture might be there creating re-fracture in remote future!5. Some antibiotics may result in the formation of anti-bigamy and pains on touch due to hardness! But never malignant or any serious disease! Therefore, if still worried, get it to some surgeon for needle biopsy, x-ray and confirmation. Regards,"

I havent slept at all tonight because ive had this god awful stomach pains to the fact that i feel like crying. It started out with my lower back hurting for about 3 days and it still does hurt but not as bad and now i feel like i have to constantly poop and vomit. I also have really bad dizziness and I feel really weak. I recently went to the bathroom, and it still didnt help anything, and when i looked it after i wiped it looked like coffee grounds in diarrhea. Not to be gross but im actually starting to get a little nervous. Can you please help?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. Thanks for an elucidated history. Yes, you have a problem-this is gastroenteritis. The dizziness is suggestive of an active infection with loss of electrolytes into the intestine (the reverse process due to infection). You need to consult a Doctor for clinical examination, blood pressure and pulse rate. You may need IV antibiotics and supportive medicines as there is vomiting also. Request your Mother to take you to ER"

It really hurts first thing in the morning when i get up. I m an avid runner. i ve taken 5 days off from running with no decrease in symptons.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Thank you for providing the brief history of you. As the pain is in the posterior side of the lower 1/3 of the leg it needs a thorough clinical examination and may be an x-ray as well. This pain can be due to either of the reasons - either plantar fasciitis or may be venous insufficiency. Usually these pains are muscular and may be plantar fasciitis. For which taking a physical therapy should help improve the overall symptoms and regain the mobility as well. Also, doing hot water fermentation should help reduce the pain and with simple exercises the problem can be solved. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. "
