My hemoglobin A is 68.7 g/dL, hemoglobin F is 9 g/dL, and hemoglobin E and A2 are 26 g/dL. And my wife has been diagnosed with a hemoglobin E trait. Her hemoglobin A is 9.1 g/dL and hemoglobin E and A2 are 77.1 g/dL. We are planning for a baby. What is the possibility of our baby acquiring thalassemia major? What are the other complications during or after pregnancy? I have always had mild anemia, my hemoglobin always ranges from 9.5 to 11 g/dL.",

        "answer_chatgpt": "Based on your hemoglobin levels, you are a carrier of hemoglobin E disease, and your wife has the hemoglobin E trait. If both parents carry a hemoglobin gene mutation, there is a risk of having a child with thalassemia major.\n\nIn your case, the risk of having a child with thalassemia major is 25%. This means that in every 4 pregnancies, there is a chance that one of the children may be affected by thalassemia major.\n\nDuring pregnancy, your wife may need additional monitoring and treatment to ensure a healthy pregnancy. Some possible complications during or after pregnancy include:\n\n1. Anemia: With your history of mild anemia, you and your wife may both be at risk of developing more severe anemia during pregnancy.\n\n2. Pre-eclampsia: This condition can cause high blood pressure and damage to organs, and can occur during pregnancy.\n\n3. Gestational diabetes: Your wife may be screened for gestational diabetes during pregnancy, as her risk of developing this condition may be higher than average.\n\n4. Miscarriage: There is a slightly higher risk of miscarriage in women with thalassemia or hemoglobinopathies.\n\nIt is important to consult with your doctor before planning to conceive, to discuss these risks and potential treatments or interventions to ensure a healthy pregnancy and delivery. Your doctor may recommend genetic counseling to assess your risk and discuss any further actions or precautions you may need to take.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) The incidence of hemoglobin E-thalassemia in your case is very high, so it is likely that if you wish to have a child, then there will be a risk of passing this onto the child. There are different types of thalassemias, some which can cause serious problems such as heart failure, others involve just mild anemia. For all types of thalassemia, iron overload can occur and lead to liver damage. Anemia may also increase risk of infections. Your doctors should be able to tell you more about the specific implications for you and your wife."

No focal abnormality can be seen in the images provided (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

During pregnancy TSH was 5.7 and taken medication, after pregnancy, TSH became normal, stopped the medication as advised by the doctor. During pregnancy, heel pain was there continuously with coccyx pain. Did MRI whole spine, it was normal. Since last one month, there is no heel pain but while getting up from bed in the morning, there is a pain in both feet. She takes a few seconds to get up from bed in the morning only. She is taking Tayo 60k for seven weeks and one on monthly basis. She feels very low energy throughout the day with mild body pains. We consulted the doctor (general physician), advised CBC, TSH, vitamin D, vitamin B12. I am attaching reports. TLC was 3.97, after one week it was 3.56. Platelet was 125, after a week 158. As of now, I do not have any problem except weakness, mild body pains. Patient weight is 42 kg to 45 kg for many years. During pregnancy, it is 53 kg, now it is 43 kg. Height is 5 feet. My query is regarding TLC count and platelet. If we need some more investigations? If there is any abnormality then how fast TLC can go down. What is the reason for low TLC? Does she need to consult someone else? If after three months TLC count will be the same, is it worrisome? If it is not going down or up, is it serious? Assume it is the same for the next six months than what should I do?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. Kindly find answers of your questions as below. Your total leukocyte count and platelet were low initially. But gradually it has been improved so suggest recovery of any unnoticed infection. Moreover, the peripheral smear examination report was normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and not showing any abnormal cells that warrant further investigation. You have to still repeat CBC after few days. The TSH is high, so hypothyroidism should be ruled out. For that repeat TSH estimation after few days and investigate with T3, T4 estimation as well. If there is any abnormality, then gradually all counts go down or high and peripheral smear shows abnormal cells if blood cancer is present. It is difficult to say one reason for low WBC. But the infection can be possible. If no cause is evident then ANA estimation can be done to do work up for autoimmune disease. If your CBC values do not fall within the range in the next few days then hematologist can be consulted for a detailed evaluation. If hypothyroidism is confirmed then Levothyroxine should be started.  ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello. The reports show that your wife's vitamin D and vitamin B12 levels are low, which can cause fatigue and body pain. She is already taking vitamin D supplements, but she may need to also take vitamin B12 supplements.\n\nRegarding the TLC and platelet counts, the TLC count can change rapidly depending on various factors like infection, certain medications, and hormonal changes. In your wife's case, the TLC count has decreased slightly over a week, which could be due to recovery from a previous infection.\n\nThe platelet count is within the normal range now, but it was low initially. Low platelet count can be due to various causes like viral infections, autoimmune disorders, and certain medications. However, in your wife's case, it may have been due to a temporary decrease in bone marrow production, which is a common occurrence after a viral infection.\n\nOverall, it is best to follow up with your doctor and monitor these levels over time to make sure they stay within the normal range. If the TLC count continues to decrease or does not improve, your doctor may recommend further testing or referral to a specialist. If your wife continues to experience fatigue and body pain, your doctor may also consider other underlying conditions that could be causing these symptoms.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. Your wives TLC counts and platelet values are within normal ranges. The counts are slightly lower than normal range and they may vary during different times. It is common for count to decrease during pregnancy and also after delivery. In your case, it has come back to near normal levels. If you feel that she needs further evaluation, you can consider doing complete blood count at regular intervals. This will help to see if the counts are decreasing over time and also to see if there is any other cause for decreased counts."

But, no hurry to get it done. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello, thank you for reaching out with your question. It sounds like your son may have a condition called phimosis, which is quite common in young boys. Phimosis occurs when the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back over the head of the penis. While this condition is usually painless, it can sometimes cause difficulty with urination or lead to infections.\n\nIn most cases, phimosis resolves on its own as the child grows and the foreskin becomes more flexible. However, in some cases, treatment may be necessary. In your son's case, it's possible that the steroid cream has helped to alleviate the symptoms of phimosis, but it's important to continue monitoring the situation.\n\nI would recommend speaking with your son's pediatrician or a pediatric urologist about his condition. They can evaluate him and determine whether any further treatment is necessary, such as circumcision or a procedure to widen the opening of the foreskin.\n\nOverall, it's important to keep a close eye on your son's symptoms and seek medical attention if you have any concerns.",

However, complications can arise if you become pregnant and your fetus is Rh positive while you are Rh negative. This situation can lead to Rh incompatibility during and after pregnancy. To avoid complications, you will need to receive an injection of Rh immunoglobulin 28 weeks into your pregnancy, and within 72 hours after delivery or miscarriage. This will prevent your immune system from producing antibodies that could be harmful to your baby in future pregnancies. It is important to discuss this with your doctor for proper management.",

        "answer_chatgpt": "Great question! Our skin goes through various changes as we age, and it's important to know what to expect at each stage to take proper care of it.\n\nIn our 20s:\n- Our skin is still relatively youthful and resilient, with good collagen production and elasticity.\n- Acne may still be a concern for some individuals, but this tends to improve as we progress through our 20s.\n- A good skincare regimen at this age should focus on cleansing, hydration, and sun protection. Be sure to avoid tanning and use a daily sunscreen of at least SPF 30.\n\nIn our 30s:\n- Signs of aging start becoming more noticeable.\n- Skin may start to appear dull or uneven in texture.\n- Fine lines and wrinkles start appearing, especially around the eyes and mouth.\n- It's important to incorporate anti-aging ingredients into your skincare routine, such as retinol and antioxidants like vitamin C. A good moisturizer is also key to keeping the skin hydrated and plump.\n\nIn our 40s and beyond:\n- Collagen production decreases, leading to sagging and wrinkles.\n- Skin becomes thinner and more delicate.\n- Age spots and other pigmentation issues become more common.\n- Skincare at this stage requires focus on firming and hydrating the skin. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid and peptides can be helpful to maintain elasticity and prevent moisture loss. Retinol and other skin resurfacing treatments can also help to reduce signs of aging.\n\nWhen it comes to caring for the skin, there are a few key tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. Stay hydrated by drinking enough water and using products that lock in moisture, like a good moisturizer or facial oil.\n\n2. Protect your skin from the sun's harmful UV rays by using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30.\n\n3. Use a gentle cleanser that won't strip the skin of its natural oils.\n\n4. Incorporate anti-aging ingredients into your skincare routine, such as retinol, vitamin C, and peptides.\n\n5. Exfoliate regularly to promote skin cell turnover and maintain a bright, even complexion.\n\nAs for when to start using acid toners and retinol products - it's best to start slowly and gradually build up over time. Acid toners can be used once or twice a week at first, and retinol products should be introduced gradually to minimize any sensitivity or irritation. Always follow the instructions on the product packaging, and consult with a skincare professional if you have any questions or concerns.",

        "input": "Hello doctor,Is high intake of protein powder helpful or harmful to the health? And what is considered as too much protein?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The recommended dietary intake of protein is 30% of your total calorie or food intake, which means 30% of what you eat should be proteins. If it exceeds 45 or 50%, then it can cause problems, especially to your kidneys. High protein powders can be used if you have protein deficiency or if your normal diet does not supply adequate protein. If you are asking this for bodybuilding purpose, then taking a very limited quantity over a short period is considered to be fine. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! While protein is an essential macronutrient that we need to build and maintain muscle mass, too much of anything can be harmful, including protein powder. High intake of protein powder can be harmful because the body can only absorb and utilize a certain amount of protein at a time, and excess protein can lead to several health consequences such as kidney damage, dehydration, and increased risk of heart disease or cancer.\n\nThe recommended daily intake of protein for an average adult is about 0.8 grams/kg of body weight, which means that a person who weighs 68 kg would need about 55 grams of protein per day. However, this amount can vary based on a person's age, sex, weight, and physical activity level. Generally, it's best to get your protein from whole food sources, such as meat, fish, and beans rather than overloading on protein powders. \n\nIn conclusion, high intake of protein powder may not be helpful to health, and exceeding the recommended daily intake can have harmful effects. It's best to consume protein from a balanced diet and consult with a health professional if you're considering supplementing with protein powder.",

You may also want to gradually decrease the frequency of feedings, such as dropping one feeding at a time, to avoid engorgement or discomfort. If you choose to introduce formula, it's important to do it gradually to allow your baby's digestive system to adjust and prevent any potential digestive issues.

My husband has a pleural effusion and has had four CT scans, none of which show any suspicious mass. Cytology records are inconclusive.

While a pleural effusion can make it more difficult to detect a lung cancer on a CT scan, it is still possible to see any visible tumor within the lung tissue. It is important to note that pleural effusions themselves can have many underlying causes, some of which may not be cancer-related. It is good that your husband has had multiple CT scans and that the cytology records have been reviewed, which provides a detailed evaluation of the fluid withdrawn. However, in unclear cases, your husband's doctor may suggest additional imaging tests or further diagnostic procedures, such as a biopsy or PET scan, which may help in clarifying the diagnosis. A middle lobe collapse can also be a sign of lung cancer, but again, it could also have other underlying causes. In any case, it is important that your husband continues to follow up with his healthcare provider and undergoes all necessary tests and examinations to determine the root cause of his symptoms.",

The most common reason being the size of the lesion or its location. Also, there are other causes of pleural effusions like tuberculosis, pneumonia etc. So first you need to get his chest x-ray done to rule out these conditions. Then he needs to undergo an ECG and echocardiography to rule out heart diseases. And then only a thoracotomy can tell whether there is a malignant growth or not."

For more information consult an internal medicine physician online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! Insulin resistance and diabetes are closely related. Insulin resistance means that your body is not responding properly to the insulin that your pancreas is producing. This condition can eventually lead to diabetes if left untreated. Diabetes occurs when your body is unable to produce sufficient insulin to regulate blood sugar levels.\n\nIf you have high fasting blood sugar levels (140+) in the morning, you may have either prediabetes or diabetes. To determine if you have insulin resistance, you can get an insulin resistance test, such as the fasting insulin test or the glucose tolerance test. These tests measure your body's insulin levels and how well your body is utilizing insulin.\n\nI would also recommend getting a complete blood workup, including an A1C test, which measures your average blood glucose levels over the past three months, to determine your overall health status. Losing weight is an excellent way to manage both insulin resistance and diabetes. By losing weight, you can improve the way your body responds to insulin and make it easier to manage blood sugar levels.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, thanks for posting your query. You can check for insulin resistance by getting fasting plasma glucose levels checked after an overnight fast of 8 hours.

In case they remain high than you may require treatment with medications to lower them. You may also require some form of exercise like walking, jogging etc. Hope this helps."

If the cavity has only affected the enamel and has not yet reached the dentin layer beneath it, it may be reversible with good oral hygiene practices and fluoride treatment. However, if the cavity has progressed beyond the enamel and into the dentin or pulp of the tooth, it will require a filling or other restorative treatment.\n\nI would recommend scheduling an appointment with your dentist for an evaluation and treatment recommendations.

Right from when we got married, he never was interested in sex. He has sex when I force him too much and for having kids. Is it due to a low amount of testosterone in him? Can it be rectified via a testosterone injection? If that is the case, will he be interested in sex only or will his whole personality change? He is very emotional and helps out with everything. I do not want that to be changed.Thanks for your time.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I can understand your concern. 1 & 2. A lot of individuals have the habit of procrastinating. If there are no other associated symptoms, we cannot label this as psychological. You have mentioned that you have low self-esteem and you think a lot about past. Sometimes, you feel worthless and these symptoms might be associated symptoms. Delaying anything without any reason could be due to lack of motivation, initiative or judgment. This should be properly evaluated. This might be due to underlying mood disturbance. Mild depression can cause similar presentation. If there are no such symptoms and you just have the issue of procrastination, then this is not an alarming thing. Try to remain relaxed, make a proper routine of your day to day activities and follow that routine. This will help improve the functioning. Once you are engaged in your routine, the problem of feeling worthless will also go. Try to get pleasure by finishing the work on time and this will motivate you to do more and ultimately the worthlessness symptoms will go. 3. You have mentioned that your husband is an awesome guy and is emotionally very supportive. But, one issue is that he is not very interested in sex. If he has low interest in sex but during sex, if he is getting good erections, then I do not think there is a problem of low testosterone. I hope he is not overweight and has mesomorphic build. In obese individuals, low testosterone could cause problems. Still, to get a clear picture, you can talk with him and get his serum testosterone and prolactin levels done. This will rule out any hormonal cause. Testosterone injections are given for hypogonadism and this will improve the libido and erection of individual.

        "answer_chatgpt": "Dear,\n\nThank you for reaching out with your queries. I will do my best to offer some guidance and information here.\n\n1. Procrastination: Procrastination can be related to psychological factors such as anxiety, depression, or ADHD. It can also be related to poor time management skills or simply a lack of motivation. To identify the cause of your procrastination, it may be helpful to see a mental health professional who can assess and diagnose any underlying issues. To address procrastination, techniques such as setting realistic goals, using time management tools, breaking tasks down into smaller steps, and creating a structured routine may be helpful.\n\n2. Low self-esteem: Low self-esteem is often the result of negative experiences and messages we have internalized from our surroundings. These negative self-beliefs can be addressed through therapy, where you can work on recognizing and challenging these thoughts and replacing them with more positive ones. You can also try practicing self-care, setting achievable goals and focusing on personal growth, and developing a healthy support system that consists of positive and supportive individuals.\n\n3. Interest in sex: Low testosterone levels can potentially impact sexual desire, but it is important to note that there can be various reasons why someone might not be interested in sex. It is best to have your husband be evaluated by a physician to identify any underlying medical conditions. Testosterone replacement therapy may be an option if his levels are low but it should be done under a doctor's supervision. However, it is important to note that using testosterone therapy, if it's needed, will not change his personality or his emotional kindness. \n\nI hope this information was helpful to you.

Gingivitis is the early stage of gum disease, and it can progress to more advanced stages if left untreated. Good oral hygiene habits such as brushing twice a day, flossing, and using an antiseptic mouthwash can help reverse the symptoms of gingivitis.\n\nToothpaste that contains fluoride can help prevent tooth decay and preserve gum health. If you're looking for a mouthwash to help restore the health of your gums, you might want to use an antiseptic mouthwash that contains essential oils like eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate, and thymol. These ingredients can help fight plaque, bacteria, and gingivitis.\n\nAlthough antibiotics can help fight bacterial infections, it's best to consult a dentist or physician before taking them. Moreover, it's important to understand that antibiotics cannot replace good oral hygiene habits and a professional dental cleaning.\n\nIn summary, maintaining good oral hygiene habits can help you reverse the symptoms of gingivitis. Regular visits to the dentist are the best way to prevent advanced gum disease. If you cannot afford to see a dentist, there may be community healthcare clinics or dental schools offering low-cost or free dental care.",

You achieved the target heart rate, and exercise tolerance was also fair. The changes reverted to normal in less than a minute. I do not think you need to worry as echocardiogram was normal.

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! Thanks for sharing your test reports with me. The TMT or treadmill test is a commonly used stress test to assess cardiac function under physical stress. Borderline ST segment response implies that there is a slight deviation in the electrical activity of the heart during exercise, but it is not significant enough to indicate a heart attack or other cardiac event. Fair exercise tolerance means you were able to tolerate the stress well.\n\nSince your resting ECG and echocardiogram report are normal, it indicates that there is no structural heart disease or any other significant risk factors. However, I would suggest you to follow-up with a cardiologist for a thorough evaluation and to discuss the possible cause of borderline ST segment response. You may need further evaluation or testing, such as a 24-hour Holter monitoring or a nuclear stress test or CT angiography, depending on the clinical context and your risk profile.\n\nIt is important to continue regular follow-up and take measures to reduce your cardiovascular risk through a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, and managing any coexisting medical conditions like hypertension or diabetes, if present. \n\nI hope this helps.

In case of chronic bleeding it is not so dangerous but it will remain for a long period. In this case there is a gradual increase of pressure in the brain. Patient goes to a doctor only when the bleeding is significant in case of stroke. I would like to have a look of your MRI brain scan to get a detailed view of your bleeding. If you are feeling better then no need to worry.  Take care.",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you have had a stroke. It is important to understand the type of bleeding that occurred during your stroke in order to determine its severity and potential for long-term damage.\n\nThe two types of bleeding that can occur during a stroke are intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).\n\nICH occurs when blood vessels within the brain rupture and blood leaks into the surrounding brain tissue. This type of bleeding is typically considered more dangerous because it can lead to significant damage to the surrounding brain tissue and can be life-threatening.\n\nSAH occurs when blood vessels in the brain’s surface or within the subarachnoid space (the area between the brain and the tissues that cover it) rupture and blood leaks into this space. While SAH can also be serious and may require surgery, it is generally considered less severe than ICH.\n\nThe reason why ICH is considered more dangerous is due to the amount of blood and pressure that builds up within the brain from the bleeding. This can cause significant damage to the brain tissue and increase the risk of complications such as seizures, brain swelling, and coma.\n\nIt is important to seek medical attention immediately if you suspect you have had a stroke, so that the type and severity of the stroke can be determined and appropriate treatment can begin quickly.",

I was prescribed Bactrim and the next day woke up with a rash. It turns out I was allergic. So, the next day I started a new medicine and took it for a few days. The blood stopped, but I felt pain, so I went back to the ER. They told me my UTI was gone and to stop taking the medicine. A few days later, I saw blood when I wiped after peeing, but it looks like it was in my discharge. It went on a few times, and I went back to the ER three days ago and said that I was peeing blood again. So, I am worried. I have not gotten my period this month, and no, I am not pregnant. I am a virgin. They said it was not a UTI and I was fine. I have had no pain or anything. Just now I peed and when I wiped there was blood in my discharge. It is not a lot but still freaks me out.

This is likely to be irregular shedding which can often occur in adolescence by mid-cycle in girls with secondary progesterone deficiency due to either delayed ovulation or stress-induced hormonal imbalances.

For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello, I understand that you're concerned about the blood in your discharge. If you were diagnosed with a UTI a month ago, it's possible that you still have some inflammation or irritation in your bladder or urethra, which can cause some spotting or light bleeding. It's also possible that the initial infection wasn't fully treated, or that you developed a second infection.\n\nSince you're not sexually active, it's less likely to be an STD or cervical issue. That said, it's still important to get a proper evaluation from a healthcare provider to make sure there's nothing more serious going on.\n\nTo determine whether this is a period or not, pay attention to the amount of bleeding and whether it's similar to your normal menstrual pattern. If it's light bleeding that lasts only a few days, it's more likely to be spotting. If it's heavier and lasts several days, it could be your period.\n\nI recommend making an appointment with your primary care physician or gynecologist to discuss your concerns and get a proper evaluation. The doctor may recommend a pelvic exam, urine test, or other tests to determine the cause of the bleeding. They may also prescribe antibiotics or other treatments if they suspect an infection or other issue. In the meantime, make sure you're drinking plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated and monitor any changes in your symptoms.",

        "input": "Hello doctor,I am urinating too frequently, around 10 to 15 times a day. If I drink a coffee or glass of water I will have to urinate around three times in the following hour. I often feel a sense of urgency before urination, and I often only produce a very small amount of urine when I go. Sometimes during or after sexual intercourse, I experience some pain like a sense of pressure in my lower region. Sometimes during exercise (or if I am jumping), I experience a small amount of urine leakage. I have had these symptoms for around two years. I have recently been visiting a urologist to discuss these symptoms. I have seen the urologist four times. Each time I visit I give a urine specimen. During my first three visits, bacteria and a high count of white blood cells were found in my urine, which was subsequently treated with a number of different antibiotics. The antibiotic that cleared the bacteria is called Levofloxacin. I was told to try daily Kegel exercising to help with urine incontinence, which I am currently doing.When I visited the urologist again yesterday I had an even higher count of white blood cells and bacteria than my previous visits. He has again prescribed Levofloxacin and told me to come back in two weeks. He suggested me taking one of two possible medications to control frequent urination called: an anti-choline or B3 stimula. He explained these medications can be taken long-term for a year or two. I expressed concern that if the persistent infections are causing frequent urination I do not want to try a different medication to control this. I am very confused about what is causing my symptoms, is it a reoccurring UTI or something that needs long-term treatment from the other medications he suggested?",

        "answer_chatgpt": "Based on the symptoms you described and the repeated presence of bacteria and white blood cells in your urine, it sounds like you may have a chronic urinary tract infection (UTI) or another underlying condition affecting your urinary tract. The fact that you've been experiencing these symptoms for two years is also concerning and suggests that a more in-depth evaluation may be necessary.\n\nAlthough antibiotics like Levofloxacin can effectively clear bacterial infections, it's possible that the infection is not fully resolved or that you are being re-infected. If your symptoms persist despite ongoing antibiotic therapy, your urologist may need to perform further tests (such as a cystoscopy or other imaging studies) to identify any structural abnormalities or other issues that could be contributing to your urinary problems.\n\nIn terms of the medications your doctor suggested for controlling frequent urination, anticholinergics and B3 stimulants can be effective for certain types of bladder control issues, such as overactive bladder or urge incontinence. However, as you pointed out, it's important to address the underlying cause of your symptoms before resorting to long-term medication use. If your symptoms are related to a chronic UTI or another underlying condition, treating that issue may ultimately be the best way to improve your bladder function.\n\nIn summary, it may be helpful to seek a second opinion or discuss your concerns with your urologist to ensure that you are getting the most appropriate treatment for your condition.",

Last few days his urine has turned this dark red color again. Looks like blood but is not every time he wees. It happens about once a day. Is this a medical emergency? Is it related to the appendix or is it a different problem? What could it be?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Dark red colored urine means blood mixed with urine and is generally arising from the urinary tract. That means either from urinary bladder (common) ureter (less common) and kidney rarely but cannot be due to appendix unless it has locally affected the above-mentioned organs. Second is it an emergency? Yes, because losing blood is always an emergency and needs to be stopped as early as possible. Regards. For more information consult an internal medicine physician online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your son's ordeal. The dark red color of his urine is concerning, and it could be related to his previous appendicitis and subsequent surgery. It is possible that the bladder or the urinary tract could have been irritated during the catheterization procedure, or there may still be some inflammation from the previous infection.\n\nHowever, this symptom could also suggest another issue such as a kidney infection, kidney stones, bladder infection, or even a bleeding disorder. I would recommend that your son see a doctor as soon as possible to get an evaluation and have his urine tested. The doctor may also want to do a physical exam, blood tests, and imaging studies such as an ultrasound or CT scan to determine the underlying cause of the symptom.\n\nIt is best not to delay seeking medical attention, especially given your son's recent medical history. If the red urine is accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, pain, or difficulty urinating, you may want to consider going to an emergency room.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1st, there is no need to panic as your son has undergone an appendectomy and hence the red colored urine can only be due to blood in urine (hematuria). As he is already having a urinary tract infection, I would advise him to start antibiotics for that as well. Once the infection is treated, the hematuria will also subside. I hope this information helps."

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nIt is true that most people who are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) are able to clear the virus from their bodies without any long-term consequences. However, about 5-10% of people who get infected with HBV are unable to clear the virus and develop chronic hepatitis B infection. Chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and other complications.\n\nBased on your test results, you have evidence of past exposure to HBV, but your current test results are negative for HBsAg, which means that you do not have an active hepatitis B infection. The positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) indicates that you have had a previous HBV infection, but it cannot determine whether the infection was acute or chronic.\n\nIf you develop HBsAg positivity in the future, it may indicate the presence of an active HBV infection. However, if you do not develop HBsAg positivity and your hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) levels become detectable, it may indicate that you have cleared the infection and developed immunity.\n\nIn summary, the majority of people who are infected with HBV are able to clear the virus from their bodies without any long-term consequences. However, some people may develop chronic hepatitis B infection, which can lead to liver damage and other complications.

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nBased on your symptoms, it is possible that you have a condition called edema, which is the accumulation of fluid in the tissues, and it can occur for various reasons. In your case, it seems that alcohol consumption worsens it, which suggests that it could be related to liver dysfunction. However, since you had a normal liver function test (LFT) a year ago, other causes of edema should be considered.\n\nOne potential cause of edema is heart or kidney problems, but a normal ECG and general health checkup make these less likely. Another possibility is a hormonal imbalance, such as low protein levels or low thyroid function, although you mentioned that your thyroid test was normal.\n\nGiven that the edema is most prominent on the days after consuming alcohol, it would be advisable to limit your alcohol intake or eliminate it altogether, and see if this affects your symptoms. Alcohol can impair liver function and lead to fluid buildup, and reducing or avoiding it may help improve your condition.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining a healthy diet and exercise regimen can also help reduce fluid retention. Focusing on foods that are low in sodium and high in potassium, such as fruits and vegetables, can help balance the fluids in your body. Exercise can also promote better circulation and help reduce edema.\n\nIf your symptoms persist despite these interventions or worsen over time, it may be a good idea to return to your healthcare provider for further evaluation to rule out any other underlying causes.",

However, I can provide you with some information that may be helpful. \n\nThyroid dysfunction has been associated with mood disorders, including anxiety, depression, and OCD. When thyroid hormone levels are not within the normal range, they can impact brain function and lead to symptoms like the ones you're experiencing. \n\nAn elevated level of FT3 can be a sign of hyperthyroidism, which occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. However, other factors could cause an elevated FT3, such as stress, illness, or certain medications. Therefore, it would be best to discuss these results with your doctor or an endocrinologist who can evaluate your situation and determine if additional testing or treatment is necessary. \n\nIt's worth noting that while thyroid medication can improve thyroid function and alleviate symptoms, it may not cure underlying mental health issues like anxiety or OCD. Alongside medication, therapy or other forms of treatment can be helpful for managing these conditions. \n\nIn conclusion, periodic FT3 level increases could contribute to your symptoms, but it would be best to consult a medical professional for a full assessment of your situation.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Your TSH is normal (3.2) and so is your Free Thyroxin Index (FT4). The only thing which needs attention is your Free Triiodothyronine (FT3). It is raised. So, it is essential for me to know whether you have any symptoms of hyperthyroidism or not. As you are using sertraline, it may take some time to show its effect. So, I suggest you continue taking sertraline for at least another month before changing anything. You need to get a repeat FT3 done after about a week. If it is still high, then you will need to get a scan done to see whether there is any problem in the gland itself. And then change the treatment accordingly. Hope this helps."

        "input": "Hi doctor,What are the long-term consequences of bad posture? Please explain.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. Poor posture is likely to cause structural changes or fixed musculoligamentous issues. The outcome and timing is dependent on the starting point. By this I mean, if this starts in early childhood, one will notice the changes by late adulthood. The severity of symptoms and actual clinical effects do not follow a straight line path and many other factors, including genetic, environmental, etc., play important roles in expression of symptoms. Further, the cause of poor posture such as muscle weakness, bony cause, trauma, neurological. etc., have their own natural history. Poor posture is likely to cause backache, stiffness, increased likelihood of sustaining injuries to the hip, knee and shoulder, appearance anomalies, etc., and in extreme cases, breathing problems due to sustained pressure and lack of space for expansion of the lung. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Bad posture can have many long-term consequences on your health. The most common consequences of bad posture include:\n\n1. Chronic pain - The main consequence of bad posture is chronic pain. Poor posture can lead to strain to your muscles and joints, which can cause chronic pain in the neck, back, and shoulders.\n\n2. Musculoskeletal disorders - Bad posture can lead to musculoskeletal disorders such as herniated discs, arthritis, and spinal stenosis.\n\n3. Reduced lung capacity - Poor posture can affect your ability to breathe. If you slouch, you compress your lungs making it more difficult to take deep breaths, which reduces your lung capacity.\n\n4. Digestive issues - Poor posture can also cause digestive problems such as acid reflux because your digestive system becomes compressed.\n\n5. Fatigue - Poor posture can lead to fatigue because it puts more pressure on your muscles, making them work harder.\n\n6. Headaches - Poor posture can also lead to headaches due to muscle strain and tension in your neck and shoulders.\n\n7. Poor circulation - Poor posture can also affect your circulation, leading to issues like varicose veins and deep vein thrombosis.\n\nTo prevent these long-term consequences of bad posture, it is essential to practice good posture habits such as keeping your shoulders back, standing up straight, and keeping your spine aligned when sitting or standing. If you are experiencing pain or discomfort due to poor posture, you should see a physician or physical therapist to develop a treatment plan.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, thanks for posting your query at Chat Doctor! Bad posture can lead to problems such as pain in back and neck muscles, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, breathing difficulties, digestive disorders, gastrointestinal problems etc. Postural problems can also cause a person to have difficulty sleeping or concentrating. It may also result in decreased physical activity levels which further worsens the condition. It is therefore important to maintain good posture. You should avoid prolonged sitting in one position and try to change positions often. Take frequent breaks during work or study sessions. Get up from your desk and walk around every hour. Wear comfortable clothes that do not restrict movement. Avoid wearing high heels. Do regular exercises like Yoga, Tai Chi etc., to strengthen muscles and improve spine flexibility.

For that above limited information as you have not mentioned your age and sex here which is very very important for any clinician and if the question is specific about some sexually transmitted disease, because pH of male and female genital organs are different, so all bacterial and viral flora growth can be different according to sex. As you have told that you have had protected intercourse five months back, so it always decreases the chances of STDs (sexually transmitted disease) in any partner and you also mentioned that all reports of your related to STD are negative so I think no need to worry now as you have crossed the incubation period of almost all sexually transmitted diseases (five months is a big time). For your query about the HSV index, I think it is negative (I could not comment on the specificity of IgG, however even if it is nonspecific no matters, cause your index values are negative). So do not worry, results are conclusive definitely (officially, index value greater than 1.1 is considered positive and index value below 0.9 indicates a negative result). If the IgG test is negative, and at least six months have passed from the time of possible infection, you do not have herpes. Number between 0.9 and 1.1 is equivocal. Antibody to HSV-2 may or may not be present. Do not worry. Eat healthy and stay healthy. ",

However, in general, the best imaging modality for detecting a sports hernia may depend on a number of factors such as the availability of the imaging modality, the experience of the imaging specialist, and the specific needs of the patient. Each of the three imaging modalities you mentioned above (dynamic ultrasound, 3T MRI, and CT scan) has its own advantages and disadvantages. \n\nDynamic ultrasound is a relatively inexpensive and non-invasive imaging technique that can provide real-time images of the soft tissues of the hip and groin area. It may be particularly useful in identifying soft tissue injuries such as muscle tears and may be performed during physical examination. However, it may be less effective in identifying bony abnormalities.\n\nA 3T MRI is a more sensitive imaging technique that can provide detailed images of the bones, soft tissues, and internal organs of the body. It may be particularly useful in identifying structural abnormalities such as bone fractures, cartilage injuries, and hernias. However, it may be more expensive and time-consuming than ultrasound, and patients may need to lie still for a long time during the imaging procedure.\n\nA CT scan can provide detailed images of the bones and internal organs in the body, and may be particularly useful in identifying bony injuries or abnormalities. However, like MRI, it may be more expensive and expose patients to higher levels of radiation. \n\nUltimately, the best imaging modality to detect a sports hernia may depend on the individual patient's clinical presentation and the expertise of the imaging specialist.

These include retinoids, topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, and hormonal therapies (such as birth control pills). The choice of treatment depends on the severity and type of acne, as well as other factors such as age, sex, and medical history. It is best to see a dermatologist for an evaluation and personalized treatment plan.",

Went to the second dentist for a second opinion. He said I have to wait for another two to four more weeks to even get started. Does this sound normal? Actually, I had a cap on the same tooth 18 months ago, and that busted directly above. I can feel with my tongue that it protrudes lower.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. You have mentioned that the present tooth problem has been there for two months. You have already had a crown in the same tooth before eight months. Have you undergone a root canal treatment for the same? It would be better if you could attach the following: 1. An intraoral photograph of the affected tooth. 2. An x-ray (intraoral periapical radiograph) of the affected tooth. The exact diagnosis and the treatment plan can be decided after going through the above. Since you have been having the busted tooth for two months, I assume that there was either no pain or very minimal pain. Because if there was any abscess or infection related to that tooth, you might have had severe pain, pus discharge or swelling. So, the chances of acute infection are very minimal. There is no emergency and may be this is the reason why your dentist had asked to wait for two to four weeks. If there was any infection at present, your dentist might have put you under medications and would have asked you to come for extraction in three to four days. May be there is gross decay of tooth or there is no scope for saving the tooth, and that is why the dentist had advised extraction (pull out the tooth). I can comment on the treatment plan only after seeing the picture and x-ray. If you are going to get the tooth extracted, then it can be replaced by either implant (screw and cap) or fixed partial denture or removable partial denture depending upon your choice. I hope this helps. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! Sorry to hear about your dental issues. It's difficult to provide a definitive answer without examining your tooth and discussing your case in detail with you, but I can provide general information that might help.\n\nWhen a tooth is broken or damaged, the optimal approach will depend on the degree of damage and the patient's unique circumstances. Sometimes, a root canal and crown will suffice to restore a tooth, but in other cases extraction and implant may be necessary.\n\nIf you need an implant, you may need to wait a few weeks to allow the area to heal after the tooth is extracted. This period of time is called a \"healing period.\" During this time, the implant site will gradually heal, and the bone will fuse with the implant post. After the healing period is complete, a crown or other restoration can be attached to the implant.\n\nThe duration of the healing period will depend on the extent of your dental issue, your overall oral health, and other factors. Waiting for a few weeks to get started with an implant procedure is not unusual in many cases.\n\nIf you remain unsure about what the best option for your tooth is or want more details, it's best to discuss further with your dentist. They're the best qualified to advise you based on your specific case.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As your dentist has recommended you not to remove the tooth right now as there is a possibility of infection in the root canal which may lead to pain and swelling of the gums. There might be a chance of nerve injury if you go ahead removing the teeth without any proper evaluation. So better to visit your dentist once again and discuss all the possible options available before going ahead with extraction of teeth. Hope it helps. Feel free to contact for further queries. Regards."

        "input": "Hello doctor,Is HIV RNA, QL TMA accurate after 20 to 21 days of exposure? And also this came with my results. RNA is not detected. No laboratory evidence of HIV infection. The HIV-1 RNA qualitative TMA assay is recommended for use as part of a multi-test HIV-1/HIV-2 screening and diagnostic algorithm. This assay can also be used to resolve indeterminate HIV-1 antibody assay results, and to test for HIV-1 infection in patients less than 2 years old. When a fourth generation HIV multi-test screening and diagnostic algorithm is used, if the test results include a repeatedly reactive HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody (fourth generation) screen, followed by negative confirmatory tests for HIV-1 and 2 antibodies and HIV-1 RNA by TMA, the most likely interpretation is a non-specific (biological false positive) reaction in the fourth generation screening assay. There is no current laboratory evidence of HIV infection. Repeat testing on a second specimen is not generally indicated but may be appropriate if there are known risk factors for recent HIV exposure. If the recent HIV-2 infection is suspected, additional testing by HIV-2 DNA or RNA, qualitative, real-time PCR should also be considered. Can someone explain this to me?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. HIV RNA PCR test is accurate after 9 to 13 days after the risk exposure. It can be used to detect early infection with HIV when most other screening tests are not yet reliable. However, it is not a confirmatory test and an early screening with RNA PCR should be followed by a more sensitive and specific screening test, this is the fourth generation antigen-antibody HIV screening test at four weeks and at 12 weeks. Therefore, RNA PCR is quite useful in the detection of early infection. Other times this test can be useful as a second test after an indeterminate fourth generation HIV screening test or when a positive HIV screening test is followed by a negative confirmatory test (usually a western blot). In the second scenario, if RNA PCR turns up as negative then it suggests that an earlier positive screening test was most likely a false positive.  ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! Yes, the HIV RNA, QL TMA test is accurate after 20-21 days of exposure. Based on the results you provided, the test did not detect the presence of HIV RNA in your blood, which means that there is no evidence of HIV infection at this time.\n\nThe statement that you received with your results explains that the HIV-1 RNA qualitative TMA assay is a recommended test for screening and diagnosing HIV, and that it can be used to resolve indeterminate HIV-1 antibody assay results. In other words, if there is uncertainty about the results of other HIV tests, the RNA test can help to confirm whether someone is infected with HIV or not.\n\nThe statement also discusses the possibility of a \"biological false positive\" result, which can happen when the fourth generation HIV multi-test screening and diagnostic algorithm produces a positive result even though the person does not actually have HIV. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including recent vaccinations or infections with other viruses.\n\nOverall, the results of your HIV RNA, QL TMA test indicate that there is no laboratory evidence of HIV infection at this time. However, repeat testing may be indicated in some cases, especially if there are known risk factors for recent HIV exposure. If you have concerns about your HIV status or need further clarification about your test results, I would recommend speaking with your healthcare provider.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " I would like to make sure that you have understood the report correctly. You had an exposure to HIV. You were tested for HIV antibodies and it was negative. You then took another test called HIV RNA which is a viral load test. Your result was normal. So there is no evidence of HIV infection. What this means is that even though your first test was negative, you must still continue to practice safe sex because the virus might have been there. In other words, these two tests do not rule out HIV infection completely."

You may need to reduce your weight, avoid alcohol completely, take a carbohydrate-controlled diet, avoid high-fat foods, and increase physical activity. Medications are not always required and lifestyle modifications can help in most cases.\n\nRegarding your current symptoms of excessive gas, bloating, and discomfort in the neck and food pipe, it may be due to acid reflux, especially if it is relieved by taking PudinHara or Raciper plus. To better manage this, you can try antacids, such as Omez, for a few days. Lifestyle changes, such as avoiding late-night meals, alcohol, spicy or fatty foods, and weight reduction, may also help.\n\nSince you have microalbuminuria, it is important to manage your blood glucose and blood pressure levels appropriately, as uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension can make this condition worse. Regular monitoring of kidney function is also important.\n\nI suggest you to consult with your doctor regarding any changes in medications or dosages and to get a proper evaluation of your symptoms. Your doctor may also suggest further management plans based on your current health condition.\n\nTake care.",

The scar is just below my nose. What are the treatments available to remove scars completely? I have attached a picture of the area.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have read your query and seen your picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). For more information consult a general surgeon online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your accident and the scarring that resulted from it. Based on the picture you've attached, it appears that you have hypertrophic scarring, which is characterized by raised, thick, and often red or pigmented scars that do not go beyond the wound area. Hypertrophic scars can be quite persistent and difficult to treat, but there are several options that you can consider:\n\n1. Topical treatments: There are various over-the-counter creams and ointments that claim to reduce the appearance of scars, such as silicon-based products, vitamin E, and aloe vera. However, the evidence supporting their effectiveness is limited, and some may even cause irritation or allergic reactions.\n\n2. Laser therapy: This is a non-invasive procedure that uses intense beams of light to break down scar tissue and stimulate collagen production. There are several types of lasers that are used for scar treatment, including pulsed dye lasers, fractional lasers, and ablative lasers. The choice of laser depends on the type and severity of the scar, as well as your skin type and sensitivity.\n\n3. Steroid injections: Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can be injected directly into the scar to reduce inflammation and flatten the tissue. They are particularly effective for hypertrophic scarring and keloids, and may need to be repeated several times until the desired results are achieved.\n\n4. Surgery: If the scar is large or deep, surgical excision may be necessary to remove the damaged tissue and replace it with healthy skin. This is usually done under local anesthesia, and may require sutures or grafting to close the wound. However, surgery carries the risk of additional scarring and may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n5. Microneedling: This is a minimally invasive procedure that uses tiny needles to create micro-injuries in the skin, which stimulate the production of collagen and elastin. Microneedling can be combined with topical or injectable treatments to enhance their effectiveness, and may require multiple sessions for optimal results.\n\nIt's important to consult with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon who specializes in scar treatment to evaluate your options and develop a personalized treatment plan that meets your needs and expectations. They can also advise you on how to care for your scar during the healing process and minimize its visibility over time.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Thanks for writing your question. I am Chat Doctor.  You can get rid of your scar by using laser therapy or chemical peeling.

I started pumping it which I usually have to do when it is empty before I reached my nostril, and a puff sprayed into my left eye. As I heard the sound, I immediately closed my eye, and then rushed to the sink and rinsed it. I continued to rinse it and even made an \"eye bath\" out of a shot glass. Though the capillaries in the outer corner of my eye are slightly inflamed, it is not burning though, just a little blurry. That could also be because I was shining my phone flashlight into my eyes to see if both pupils were reacting normally, which they are. Is this emergency and should I be more concerned? Or should I be doing something more?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. For how long it is blurry? Did it improve at all or not? Give a thorough wash for at least half an hour with clean water. If the vision improved after washing, then there is no need to be the worry, but if it is still blurry, then you must consult for any corneal lesion. For more information consult an ophthalmologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "It's good that you rinsed your eye out immediately after the spray got in there. It sounds like you did the right thing in taking quick action. Often, that is all that's needed to prevent serious injury to the eye. \n\nThe inflamed capillaries you are seeing are likely a result of the irritation caused by the spray. It's a good sign that your eye isn't burning, but the blurry vision is still worth keeping an eye on. \n\nIf you're continuing to experience blurry vision, it's probably best to get checked out by a doctor. However, if the blurry vision goes away in a day or so and there isn't any irritation, you may be okay to simply keep an eye on it at home. \n\nIn general, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your eyes. If you notice any changes in vision, pain, or excessive redness, it's best to seek medical attention right away.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1. You should be very careful when using any kind of nasal sprays as you might end up getting them in your eye by accident.2. It is advisable that you use a different brand or another type of nasal spray altogether to avoid such accidents.3. The symptoms that you describe seem to be related to the irritation caused by the fluticasone nasal spray but there is nothing to worry about. The inflammation will subside with time.4. You can use artificial tears like GenTeal for temporary relief from the discomfort.5. If the symptoms persist consult your ophthalmologist who may prescribe some medications. Hope this helps."

        "input": "Hello doctor,How accurate are skin prick tests for predicting positive reactions? My family is interested in a pet and I have had negative skin prick and blood work tests for dander. Before we bring a pet in and before my kids become bonded, is it reasonable to assume negative tests will translate in no reactions. Occasionally, when I interact with animals, I have a reaction but it is difficult to determine whether it is actually the pollen which I am highly allergic to.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. Skin prick allergy testing is one of the most accurate ways of diagnosing the allergen, one is sensitive to. It is definitely more accurate than blood immunoCAP testing (blood allergy testing). Skin prick testing checks your sensitivity to the protein in question. Even if sensitive, it need not mean you are allergic. Whereby, a positive result need not always mean you will get allergy with the protein. It means that your immune system is sensitised to that allergen and that an allergy can occur in subsequent exposures to the allergen. A negative in skin prick testing will mean that you are not sensitive to that protein and that you will not end with an allergy upon its exposure. This is true. But it is specific for the particular type of allergen. What all animal danders were included in your profile and what was the response to each? Is there a photograph or record of the wheal or flare that developed after each prick? Was the test read by a clinical allergist or immunologist and were you provided a report as to that you are not allergic to any animal dander? Were you diagnosed with pollen allergy or sensitivity? Have you observed any symptoms of allergy while in gardens or bushy areas? Or in any particular season? Does any one else in your family have allergies? ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Skin prick tests are usually quite accurate for predicting positive reactions to allergens. However, there are several factors that can affect the results of these tests, including the type and severity of the allergy, the specific allergen being tested, and any medications that you may be taking at the time of the test. False negatives can also occur in some cases.\n\nEven with negative skin prick and blood tests for dander, it is still possible that you could have an allergic reaction to a pet. Allergy testing can provide some insight into your potential risk, but it is not a guarantee that you will have no reaction. If you have had reactions in the past when interacting with animals, it is important to consider this when deciding whether or not to bring a pet into your home. You may want to consider spending time with the specific type of animal you are interested in before making a final decision. It is also a good idea to talk to your doctor about strategies for managing any potential allergy symptoms that may arise.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Skin prick test can be very helpful in diagnosis of allergy. It is positive if there is redness at least 10 mm within 20 minutes after testing. It should be done by an expert dermatologist or immunologist as they know how to interpret them. You may need to repeat once or twice to get correct result. But generally they are very reliable in prediction of allergies. Hope this answers your question."

After identifying the reason you can solve it by consulting a psychologist. For now, you should avoid taking alcohol as much as possible, if you take alcohol then you should take it with less quantity, also you should avoid going alone to any pubs or club where alcohol is available. Hope you found the answer helpful. Wish you good health."

        "input": "Hello doctor,I have been having consistently a very low resting pulse, between 50 and 58 and I do not know if this is a sign of a problem. I do not have any other issues besides nausea sometimes. I am 39 years old and overweight (BMI 32.9). Should I be worried?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. This resting pulse is perfectly normal in healthy peoples. This pulse will rise once you exert. Rise in heart rate with exercise and fall during rest is a normal phenomenon that is controlled by our autonomic nervous system. In healthy persons, it even falls in 40s during sleep. So, nothing to worry. The only thing that I would like to ask you is whether you have any symptoms such as dizziness during low pulse rate? Another thing is ECG (electrocardiogram). I want to see your ECG to see whether it is a sinus rhythm or is there any block. As your cardiac workup is done and is normal, I do not think you need any more work up but if there are occasional symptoms associated with low pulse rate as graying of vision, dizziness, etc, I would advise you to have a Holter monitoring done for 24 to 48 hours to see rise and fall of heart rate during daily activities including sleep. If you have no symptoms, just relax and do not worry. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! A resting pulse rate between 50 and 58 beats per minute is not necessarily a sign of a problem, especially if you are otherwise healthy. However, given your BMI, it may be worthwhile to see your healthcare provider to rule out any underlying health conditions or risk factors that may be contributing to your low pulse rate. They may also recommend further testing to ensure that your heart function is normal. It's also important to note that some medications, such as beta blockers, can cause a lower heart rate. Overall, I recommend consulting with your healthcare provider to determine if any further evaluation is needed.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1stly your BMI is not in normal range. You should first try to reduce weight by doing regular exercise. This will help you to control your weight and also improve blood pressure, cholesterol level etc. As far as your low heart rate is concerned it is not a matter of concern unless you are feeling dizzy or fainting. In that case you need further evaluation like ECG, 2d echo and Holder monitoring."

While in hospital, she contracted C.diff and has had several recurring bouts with it. She has had a transplant and so far she is doing well with no recurrence. She also has a fistula near the rectum from an abscess. They put in a tube to keep it open and flowing. She has always had bouts of constipation and diarrhea for years before the accident. Her cognitive functions have been diminishing. One of my brothers is living with her and care taking her for full time.She is very weak, but can walk with the aid of a walker. Before the accident, she was fine. But, she may have shown a few signs of slight memory issues and balance prior to the accident as well. Our main issue right now is loose stools with some fecal incontinence. The doctor said that the fecal incontinence is because of a weak rectum that will not hold back fecal matter. Also, the fistula is always draining. When her stools are normal, she has good energy and cognitive function. When she has loose stools, she is very weak and can hardly stand or walk. Her cognitive function is a lot worse. She gets very confused about daily items and memory issues.We are looking for supplements to keep her regular and avoid the loose stool episodes. These are recurring every other week. Being so weak at the time of an episode, the toilet and the surrounding area get very filthy. She has little control and not able to clean herself properly. Her diet is pretty good. We are trying to keep dairy items away, limiting sugar and some carbohydrates as best as we can.We are giving her Metamucil when she has loose stools as well as some ammonium. This seems to have very limited success. She is on a blood pressure medicine as well as on Coumadin. So, we have to watch for interactions between everything. Regarding supplements, right now she is taking Alpha-GPC, Prevagen and multivitamins B for cognitive help, Fish oil, turmeric and Centrum multivitamins.Any help or suggestions to prevent the loose stools without creating constipation would be appreciated. I would also like to increase her core energy, so she will feel more like moving around. We have a physical therapist at once a week.",

Also, self-administration of any supplementation should be avoided.

Fiber supplements, such as psyllium husk, can also help regulate bowel movements, but again, should be used with caution in patients with diverticular disease or other digestive issues.\n\nAs for increasing core energy, regular exercise and a balanced diet can help improve overall energy levels. Gentle exercises, such as walking or chair yoga, can be beneficial for older adults with limited mobility.

In my opinion, there is not much difference between exercise echo and chemical stress echo and not invalid, but nuclear scans like stress thallium is certainly a better test.

However, stress echocardiograms are generally considered less sensitive and specific than nuclear stress tests. \n\nThat being said, stress echocardiograms can still provide valuable information about the heart function and possible signs of CAD. So, it is not entirely true that stress echocardiograms are irrelevant in patients with LBBB.

Your high HDL and low triglycerides are favorable, but your high cholesterol levels could increase your risk of CAD, especially given your family history. \n\nTherefore, I suggest discussing with your doctor the possibility of undergoing a nuclear stress test to evaluate your CAD risk. This would provide you with more accurate results than a stress echocardiogram, and it would enable you to get a clearer picture of your heart's health. \n\nFinally, I would like to emphasize the importance of continuing to follow up with your doctor regularly, especially given your family history of heart disease.

On the other hand, the regular echo is still needed as a screening tool to exclude possible heart valve problems. As far as the family history is concerned, it does increase the risk of coronary artery disease. You should try to control your cholesterol levels and blood pressure as much as possible.

The doctor told me that there is some infection in the teeth, so it needs a root canal to be done. I do not have any pain in the teeth. I have only swelling in the teeth. Please suggest what to do?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. Pain will come back after a few days if the root canal treatment is not done for the infected teeth. It is better to do a root canal treatment in the teeth as soon as possible as the pain can become unbearable. Such swelling come due to nerves that get rotten inside the teeth due to various reasons like putting a cap over it. You will need antibiotics and painkillers. For more information consult a dentist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Based on your description, it sounds like you may have an infection underneath the caps of your teeth. Since there is swelling present, a root canal therapy would be necessary to remove the infected tissue and prevent the spread of infection. The fact that you do not have any pain in the teeth is not necessarily a reliable indicator of whether or not a root canal is needed. In many cases, infections can occur without any noticeable pain. \n\nI would recommend following your dentist's advice and getting the root canal therapy done as soon as possible to prevent any further progression of the infection. Delaying treatment could lead to more pain and discomfort, and potentially to the loss of the affected teeth. If you have any questions or concerns about the procedure, your dentist will be able to provide you with more information and guide you through the process.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) Root canal treatment can be done after clinical examination and x-ray. It will depend upon the extent of infection.2) Swelling can be due to accumulation of pus inside the tooth which can cause inflammation and swelling.3) You should maintain proper oral hygiene by brushing twice daily, use mouthwash rinses like chlorhexidine or Listerine.4) I would advise you to consult your dentist for clinical examination and further management. Thank you."

I went for new glasses and they told me I had an epiretinal membrane. I have an appointment next week with the specialist, but so worried I may need surgery. My husband passed away recently and a few weeks later my mother also passed away. I did the eye graph exam (from internet search and there is no distortion). Is this something I can live with or shall I have the surgery next year? I have no one to help me and may have help next year.",

There is a jelly-like substance in the eye and as age progresses it starts to liquify and you start seeing floaters. You should go to an ophthalmologist immediately in case if there is an increase in the number of these floaters or if you are seeing flashes of light. Because these are the signs of retinal detachment. Get your retina checked at least once a year. Right now you have to ignore the floaters and you will get used to it. The surgery is only necessary if you have difficulty in seeing or retinal detachment or cataract.

They can also provide information on any visual changes that may occur over time, and how this will affect your daily activities. If surgery is required, your doctor can discuss the risks, benefits and expected outcomes of the procedure. Take care and stay safe.",

        "input": "Hello doctor,For the past two months, I have had a pretty consistent elevated heart rate. Not by a lot but noticeable for me compared to what I was coming from.I cut out alcohol and caffeine and that helped but it always returns. My resting heart rate (I wear an Apple watch) is pretty consistent in the 53-58 range. But when I get up, go up or downstairs, it will jump to 100 pretty fast, then average out in the 80\\s as I move about my day. When I am sitting at work it is 78-85 bpm. This is a good 8-10 bpm faster than when I am at peak health. I am not sure what is going on.I did a fair bit of cocaine and took some ED pills a few times (with the cocaine) before three months, so I wondered if maybe there is a connection. I have not done anything like that since then.I am a runner, but now when I run or jump it goes up to 150 bpm and higher pretty fast. If I push myself anywhere close to hard I am at 170-180 bpm pretty easily, so I slow down. And it seems my body does not recover quite as fast. So I have stopped running hard and just do light jogs, and play tennis. I recover pretty easily there. But it is annoying as I want to run and push myself.I will go two to three days with no caffeine, alcohol and then I notice my walking around rate is lower, like what it used to be mid 70\\s. When it is like that I can feel it noticeably, I feel much more complete and whole. I feel great and no shortness of breath. So then I will have a few glasses of wine that night, and maybe a dessert (I like sugar at night) and I will lay down to sleep and my heart seems to jump up to 85-95 bpm for a while and it takes two to three hours before it rests at 53-58 bpm. And then the cycle starts again. I am so confused I do not know what the deal is. Is it the alcohol or sugar? I drink this one type of white wine a lot but I have noticed my heart rate does not react as much when I just drink beer. One night, I had white wine then tequila and my resting rate was like 68-78 bpm all night. I saw a doctor about three weeks ago and they did an ECG and listened to my heart and it showed no issues or irregularities. I do not have heart pain, though I did have a few sharp pains over the past two months maybe two to three times all lasting about one second and then it is gone all when I am lying down in bed trying to go to sleep. I do have shortness of breath due to the elevated heart rate when I am carrying stuff, going upstairs, etc. I do not have pain in my chest, jaw, left arm, etc.Sorry, this is so long but I really would love to discuss this with someone who maybe has heard of this before. To be clear what is annoying and confusing me is that my heart rate will steadily be 8-10 bpm higher at all times (aside from resting rate) for like a 7-10 days before it feels like it goes back to normal. But then there is always something that sets it off again. I never see it spike over 105 or so.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello,  Welcome to ChatDoctor. I understand your concern, but I assure you that there is nothing to worry about. It is normal for the human heart rate to fluctuate. For instance, during exercise the heart rate can go as high as 350 bpm in some people it does not mean there is a problem. It is normal. It is also normal for the heart rate to slow down when laying down. But it can increase while laying down in cases where you take alcohol just like in your case. You are having issues with anxiety probably because of the cocaine you used. I advise you to resume your exercise. Start jogging, it will help with your situation. You can only worry if you begin to experience shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! It is important that you continue to seek medical attention for your elevated heart rate. Given your history of cocaine use and ED pill use, it is possible that these may have played a role in your current symptoms. Additionally, excessive alcohol and sugar intake can also impact heart rate, so it would be a good idea to monitor your consumption of these as well. \n\nIt is a good sign that your resting heart rate falls within a healthy range, but the significant jumps in heart rate with exertion or certain activities is something that should be looked into further. It may be beneficial to undergo additional testing such as a stress test or echocardiogram to assess the function of your heart. \n\nIn the meantime, it may be beneficial to focus on stress reduction techniques and relaxation exercises, as stress and anxiety can also contribute to an elevated heart rate. Engaging in regular physical activity, within your body's comfortable limits, is a good way to maintain overall heart health. \n\nOverall, I recommend consulting with a cardiologist to further assess and manage your symptoms. They can provide more specific advice tailored to your individual needs and circumstances.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Thank you for your question. I understand your concern regarding high heart rate. As you mentioned you were having high heart rate for last couple of months and also have a history of cocaine and ED pills use, which may cause damage to heart muscle. You should consult a cardiologist for proper evaluation and management. A cardiac ultrasound, lipid profile, blood sugar levels, thyroid function test and EKG will help us to evaluate further. You should avoid stress and anxiety. You need to take medicines like beta blockers to control your heart rate. Regular exercise and yoga can help to reduce anxiety. Hope this helps."

It is not uncommon for people to have multiple lipomas in the same area or in different parts of the body.\n\nHowever, it is always a good idea to have your doctor evaluate any unusual growths or lumps to rule out any serious conditions such as cancer. Your doctor may perform a physical exam and order imaging tests such as an ultrasound or MRI to confirm the diagnosis of lipoma and make sure there are no other underlying health problems. If the lipomas are causing discomfort or affecting your quality of life, your doctor may suggest surgical removal.\n\nOverall, having lipomas in the upper arm is fairly common and usually not a cause for concern.

The reason is that the flu virus is always changing, and the vaccine is designed to protect against the strains that are expected to be the most common during that flu season.\n\n2. Is it mandatory for kids?\nWhile it may not be mandatory, the CDC recommends that all individuals over six months of age receive an annual flu vaccine, including children.\n\n3.

Whenever there is infection of the pulp, the infection spreads beyond the tip of the tooth; it extrudes the tooth out of its socket within the jaw. When this happens the tooth is painful especially when it touches the opposing upper tooth. The other reason for tooth pain could be that the entire infected pulp was not removed. Either way, you need to go back to your dentist. The second issue here is the numbness of your chin and lower lip. This usually happens when the nerve in the lower jaw gets nicked by the needle while giving the local anesthetic.

I took a home pregnancy test but that was negative.My period has been fairly regular in the past with them happening 4 days prior or after my date. I have taken emergency morning after pill in the past (thrice in the last 4 months). What could be the reason? Is there a possibility that I could still be pregnant after a negative test, though I have not had any other symptoms of pregnancy nor am I having any sought of discomfort?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The striking point in your history is that you have taken morning after pill thrice in the last 4 months. It has to be understood that the most common side effect of an emergency contraceptive pill is delaying the next 2-3 menstrual cycles.  As your pregnancy test is negative even after 13 days post period, it clearly indicates that you are not pregnant . Hence, the delay in periods is likely to be due to ipill side effect. Or another possible reason for the delay could be stress induced hormonal imbalance during this menstrual cycle. Stress including emotional, psychological, physical or social disturbances, all have a bearing on the reproductive hormones and can easily delay your menses, once pregnancy is ruled out.  It is suggested that you can wait for another week to allow your menses to resume naturally , if not then you may opt for a with ChatDoctor.   As pregnancy test is negative, you can rest assured and wait for another week safely. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "There are several potential reasons why your period may be late, even after taking a home pregnancy test that was negative. Some possible causes may include stress, changes in weight or exercise routines, hormonal changes, or underlying medical conditions that may affect your menstrual cycle. It's also possible that the emergency morning after pill could have disrupted your menstrual cycle and caused a delay in your period.\n\nWhile a negative pregnancy test can be a good sign that you are not pregnant, there is still a small possibility of a false negative result. This is especially true if you took the test too early or didn't follow the instructions properly. If you're still concerned about the possibility of pregnancy, it may be a good idea to schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss additional testing options and to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be causing your delayed period.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Thanks for writing to us. The first thing we need to check is if your periods are regular. Have you gotten your periods regularly every month since you started menstruating? Pregnancy tests are very sensitive and accurate as they can detect even a single cell of a fertilized egg in the urine. It is possible that you may not have noticed any physical signs of pregnancy because it is too early for them to develop. You should wait until your next expected period and then get yourself checked for pregnancy. If you miss that period, take another pregnancy test. Other reasons for irregular cycles include stress, hormonal imbalance, poor diet, thyroid problems etc. All these can lead to irregular cycles, so it would be better to consult a gynecologist to rule out all these conditions before concluding that you are pregnant. Best wishes."

Everything was going fine until last 7 to 10 days my bowel movement has been strainful. Few days I have seen very small sized hard stools and sometimes small stool with very little water. I started taking Metamucil. However, the stomach felt bloated severely after eating anything. I sometimes feel a sudden hunger spike that becomes uncontrollable and once I eat, the stomach swells like a balloon. I also started taking one capsule of Triphala to ease out my symptoms. From past 4 to 5 days, I have started feeling fatigue and a very strong one like light handedness and no energy in my legs. I had a sore inside my mouth and that has healed significantly now. The acid reflux is there, especially while making out with my partner I felt food coming up. The consistency of stool after eating Metamucil has been more like rubber shaped long zig zag sausage with uneven and weird cracks and sometimes mucus as well. I feel gas below my stomach and sometimes have to strain hard to pass. I got my CBC done two days back (normal report), kidney, liver, thyroid (normal), Hb (normal), sugar (normal). I also got my FOBT stool test done (negative report). Are the above symptoms cigarette withdrawal symptoms? Or stomach bug? or IBS? I take the following tablets daily. one Magnesium tablet, one Menevit tablet (for sperm health and male fertility), one Omega 3 1000 mg capsule, one 64 Billion Probiotic capsule.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I went through your post, it is normal to have hard stools after quitting smoking for that you have to add a salad, do exercise, and take enough water. It is a temporary phenomenon which usually settles in three months till intestines adapt nicotine free blood. You have started laxative Metamucil which has caused gastritis. You need to stop that and continue Nexium at least 10 days daily before breakfast. That will take care of the issue. There is no need to take omega, probiotics, Menevit or Magnesium tablets. Do not take unnecessary medicines. It is not IBS.  ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Congratulations on completing 29 days without smoking! Your symptoms may not necessarily be related to cigarette withdrawal. It is possible that you may have developed gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a gastric infection. However, given your normal lab results and negative FOBT stool test, it is more likely that your symptoms are related to changes in your diet, medication use, or the consumption of Metamucil.\n\nMetamucil contains psyllium husk, which absorbs water in the gut and can cause bloating and gas. Triphala, while generally considered safe, may have laxative effects that can further exacerbate your symptoms. In addition, taking multiple supplements simultaneously may increase the risk of adverse interactions.\n\nI would recommend that you stop taking Metamucil and Triphala to see if your symptoms improve. Instead, try to incorporate more fiber-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into your diet to help regulate your bowel movements. Ensure you drink plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated.\n\nRegarding the sudden hunger spasms, it may be related to blood sugar fluctuations. Try to eat smaller, more frequent meals that are high in fiber and protein to help regulate your blood sugar levels.\n\nIf your symptoms persist or worsen, please consider consulting a gastroenterologist to help diagnose and manage your gastrointestinal issues.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) No, these are not cigarette withdrawal symptoms.  They are likely due to your body trying to get rid of the nicotine stored in your cells. 2) You will need to do some tests to make sure that it is not a stomach bug. You should see your doctor for this. 3) Yes, they could be IBS related. I would recommend that you try some over the counter anti-spasmodic medications such as Dicyclomine or Hyoscine. If you still have problems then you may want to consult your doctor who can prescribe stronger medication if needed."

And also passing urine 8 to 10 times a day. Previously, he was passing motion 4 to 5 times a day. It seems that he has loose motion. As a home remedy, we have given him Nutmeg in mother milk. Please suggest what we have to do and is there any medication for it.",

Baby\\s gut is in a transition phase of maturation, where motions from 0 to 8 times a day are normal. Continue breastfeeding, giving other than breastfeeding can be disastrous. Any home remedy is not recommended for six months. Mother\\s milk is sufficient for the baby, and he does not need anything other than that for six months. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello and congratulations on your newborn! Based on your description, it could potentially be normal for your baby to pass stool more frequently after every feed. If your baby seems comfortable and is gaining weight, it might not be necessary to worry too much about it. However, if you are concerned, it is always best to consult with your pediatrician who can evaluate your baby and offer more targeted advice.\n\nRegarding the use of nutmeg, I would caution against giving anything to your baby without consulting with your pediatrician first. Certain spices and herbs may not be safe for infants, particularly premature babies who may have particularly sensitive digestive systems.\n\nIf your baby is having symptoms of diarrhea such as frequent, loose stools, it is important to make sure your baby stays hydrated. Offer your baby frequent small feeds of breastmilk or formula. You can also offer an oral rehydration solution (such as Pedialyte) if your doctor recommends it.\n\nIn terms of medication, it is not recommended to give over-the-counter medications to infants without consulting with a pediatrician first. Some medications can be harmful or ineffective for infants, and dosing can be tricky.\n\nI hope this helps, and please don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider with any concerns you may have.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "15 days of age is too early to give anything other than breastmilk or formula.  At this age babies should be exclusively breastfed (no solids).  The fact that your baby is passing stool and urine frequently suggests that his intestines are working well.  I would not worry about his stools right now unless they become very watery, greenish, or bloody.  If you want to use nutmeg as a home remedy feel free to do so.  There is no harm in giving it to your baby."

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. Menactra Vaccine (Meningococcal Vaccine (Group A, C, Y, and W-135)) is given to prevent meningococcal disease. It is not mentioned in IAP (Indian Academy of Pediatrics) compulsory immunization schedule. But in some places where meningococcus is prevalent, this vaccine is generally advised to be administered. This vaccine has some side effects like low fever, redness or pain at the site of vaccine injection and irritability. But these are very mild in nature and can occur with other vaccines also. In my opinion, it would be better if you give the vaccine to the child because meningococcal is a fatal disease and management is very difficult if the disease occurs in a child. For more information consult a child health specialist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Menactra vaccine is a meningococcal conjugate vaccine that protects against four types of bacteria that can cause meningitis and bloodstream infections. While Menactra is not a part of the compulsory immunization schedule, it is recommended for certain individuals, including young children, teenagers, and adults who are at increased risk of contracting meningococcal disease, such as those with certain medical conditions and those traveling to areas with high rates of the disease.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Menactra may cause side effects, such as pain and swelling at the injection site, fever, headache, and muscle aches. These side effects are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days. Serious side effects from Menactra are rare but can include allergic reactions or fainting.\n\nOverall, the benefits of Menactra vaccine in protecting against potentially life-threatening meningococcal disease outweigh the risks of side effects. It is important to talk to your child's doctor about Menactra vaccine and whether it is recommended for your child based on your child's individual circumstances and medical history.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) No, meningitis vaccines are NOT part of India compulsory childhood immunizations and would need to be taken under private prescription.2) Side effect profile of Menactra contains local pain and redness at injection site, fever (low grade), headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swelling or tenderness at injection site, mild bruising, severe allergic reactions (difficulty breathing; hives; itching; rash; tightness in chest; unusual hoarseness); joint pain/swelling.3) The duration of protection is not known for meningococcal serogroup C."

Now I am using Kojivit gel. Please advise me is kojivit gel safe? How to use it, and how many days it requires to cure the dull skin and become fairer again? Please give advice.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. Melacare cream that you have been using is essentially a triple composition of Mometasone Furoate steroid, Tretinoin, and Hy ChatDoctor.  It is not meant for regular use. This cream is a prescription product and should never be used without dermatologist advice. Dermatologist commonly prescribes it for facial hyperpigmentation and melasma. However, it should never be used as a regular fairness cream and in any case, not for more than two to three months. Since the steroid content of this cream can cause various side effects like acne, photosensitivity, skin thinning, and telangiectasia and facial hair growth (hirsutism), which is especially troublesome in females. I would suggest that you use a broad-spectrum sunscreen throughout the day. At night you could use Glyco-A (glycolic acid cream) or Kojic (Kojic acid cream) to obtain the desired results of brighter complexion and even tone. You could also opt for a few peeling sessions from a dermatologist, e.g., yellow peel (Retinol CT peel) or glycolic peel or lactic acid peel. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nMelacare cream contains a combination of hydroquinone, tretinoin, and a steroid. Long-term use of this cream can cause skin thinning, increased pigmentation, and other side effects. Therefore, it is not recommended to use Melacare cream for a prolonged period.\n\nKojivit gel contains kojic acid, which is a safer alternative to hydroquinone for skin lightening. It works by inhibiting tyrosinase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in melanin synthesis. Kojivit gel is generally safe and effective for most people, but like any other topical agent, it can cause skin irritation, rash, or dryness in some cases.\n\nHere are some tips for using Kojivit gel:\n\n1. Cleanse your skin thoroughly before applying the gel.\n2. Apply a small amount of the gel on the affected area, and gently massage until it is absorbed.\n3. Use it twice a day, preferably in the morning and at night.\n4. Do not apply it on broken, irritated, or sensitive skin.\n5. Avoid exposure to direct sunlight, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 during the day.\n\nIt may take several weeks to see the results, and it varies from person to person. However, it is important to note that skin lightening is a gradual process, and overuse of skin lightening agents can do more harm than good. Therefore, it is best to use it under the guidance of a dermatologist and follow their instructions carefully.",

Other factors such as diet, stress, hormonal changes, and genetics can all contribute to hair loss. If you're worried about it, speak with your doctor or a dermatologist who can evaluate your scalp and help determine if there may be any underlying issues.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "10-20 hairs per day is not significant and should not cause any concern. It is normal for people of your age group to lose this much hair in a day. However, if you notice more than this amount then you might want to consult a dermatologist. Apart from this, you can use a mild shampoo once or twice a week with lukewarm water. You can also use almond oil on your scalp once or twice a week. Hope this helps."

So before RCT one of the corner was broken down already.After RCT, again one corner broke down again and now when I close my jaws it hurts. Also when I rub my finger slightly it hurts sometimes a little pain. No sensitivity is there with cold water but hurts little when I close my jaws or I rub my fingers on it.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctor. I have gone through your query and understood your concern. When a tooth decays and when the nerve layer of the tooth is affected, it starts to give out pain and it loses its vitality becoming more brittle. Hence it could have fractured. Also, to save such tooth, root canal treatment will be performed.  Mild pain/discomfort after RCT is quite normal for the next 3 to 5 days for which you would have been put under pain killers. This period is for tooth healing and it is essential that you do not disturb or bite food on that tooth. Once it completely heals, crown procedure is generally performed. Placing a crown over the root canal treated tooth is mandatory to protect the tooth and to prevent further fracture of the tooth. Do visit your dentist for the crown procedure and till that do not eat hard, chewy foods and avoid chewing food on the involved side. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! It sounds like you may have some lingering pain and discomfort after your root canal treatment. It's not uncommon to have some discomfort after a root canal, and it's possible that you may need some follow-up treatment to resolve the issues you're experiencing.\n\nIf one corner of your tooth broke down after your root canal, it's possible that there was already some weakness or decay in the tooth that contributed to the breakage. Additionally, it's possible that the root canal treatment may not have completely resolved the infection or inflammation that was causing your initial symptoms.\n\nI recommend making an appointment with your dentist or endodontist for an evaluation. They may take an x-ray to check the status of the tooth and see if there are any areas of concern that need to be addressed. They may also check the bite to make sure that it's not causing additional discomfort.\n\nIn the meantime, taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage any discomfort you're experiencing. Stick to softer foods and avoid using the affected tooth for chewing until you have a chance to see your dentist.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Welcome To Chat Doctor forum. Thanks For Writing To US. The pain in the teeth after RCT can be due to-1) Infection in the gums2) Due to trauma3) Due to re-infection of the root canal system4) Due to secondary caries5) Due to any other cause. Please visit your dentist and get it evaluated. Do warm saline rinses 3 - 4 times a day. Do avoid hot foods and spicy foods till time healing takes place. Take multivitamins and minerals for few days. Hope This Answer Will Help You. Let Me Know If I Can Assist You Further."

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. We call this as urinary incontinence in medical language. There are so many possibilities which can be responsible for this. Most probably your urinary bladder may fail to empty properly due to weakness of bladder muscle. For this condition, you have to get a USG (ultrasonography) done, where I want the detail about post-void residual volume. It means an ultrasonologist will take scan one before urinating and another after passing the urine in which he will mention the volume of post-void residual urine (PVU). If the volume retention is moderate, then we have to strengthen your pelvic floor muscle with some exercise and believe me it gives an excellent result and I had, treated so many patients with that exercise. Another possibility is decreased blood concentration of ADH (anti-diuretic hormones) which is, responsible for concentrating the urine and lack of this hormone is responsible for frequent urination. The last but not least, I would advise to get your blood sugar level done (both- fasting and two hours after a meal). As you know, without knowing the cause, nobody can prescribe you the medicine as it can be dangerous for you.

After consulting a doctor and after an eye dilution test, she confirmed that bleeding had occurred in my eye around two weeks ago and the black line I could see was the blood that had spilled. She sent me to a retina doctor who said he had to inject me in the eye. He did not explain the reason why and was a bit unwelcoming to the point that he did not give me a chance to inquire. He prescribed two drugs (Maxidex sterile ophthalmic ointment) and Ceprolen-D eye, ear drops). I have been using these medications since I did not have money for the injection. I can see little improvement but I am afraid it is not cleared yet.All I want to inquire is, what could be wrong with me? I underwent many blood tests and passed them all.

Injections of an anti-VEGF compound are indicated in this but before this, you need laser therapy in your eye along with a course of steroids. You need to undergo fundus fluorescein angiography to locate the area of leaky vessels and we have to laser it. You also need to get a blood investigation to rule out infections like tuberculosis. After that is ruled out, we have to start steroids. Anti-VEGF injections come after that. Kindly do not delay it if this process continues. The visual prognosis becomes poorer if not done in time. You may need surgery which would be more costly. ",

This can be caused by a number of factors, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and trauma to the eye. It is possible that the long hours spent in front of the computer without anti-glare glasses could have contributed to this problem. \n\nThe reason the retina doctor recommended an injection is likely because it can help to reduce inflammation and swelling in the eye, which can improve your vision and promote healing. Maxidex is a steroid medication that can help to reduce inflammation, and Ceprolen-D contains an antibiotic and a steroid to help fight infection and reduce inflammation. \n\nIf you are still experiencing vision problems or have concerns about your treatment, it is important to follow up with your doctor. They can reassess your condition and determine if any changes to your treatment plan are necessary.

I am 95% sure that my protection was intact. Then I started reading about the HIV symptoms and technicalities of testing online. Five days later, I went to a Dermatology and Venereology specialist and described about the incident. He was confident enough that he advised me not to go for any testing. Although my fear of infection remained.Around two months post-exposure, I felt tenderness here and there like on the back of my head, arms, one lymph node in my underarm was swollen and I developed cold and cough. I started sweating during that time as well. I looked a bit thinner. I got panicked and went to the doctor again. He checked me and was still confident that I am not infected. But for my mental satisfaction, he prescribed me thorough testing which includes HIV1/2, VDRL, HBsAg, HCV along with urine R/E, M/E, C/S analysis.On 74 th day post-exposure I took all those tests and they all came back negative. After lapse of a few days again I felt some skin irritation on theback and burning sensation on my forearms. Although no skin changes can be seen. Again I got panicked thinking that I may be in the window period for HIV. But the doctor remained confident and he adivised me not to go for any repeat testing. But my sense of fear, anxiety, panic, guilt, and impurity continues.On 110th day post-exposure again I repeated the tests but I excluded the urine analysis this time. All the tests came negative again. The HIV tests were fourth-generation combo test both the time. I am on the eighth month post exposure. Still, I feel tenderness hear and there. Recently, I am developing small red blood vessel like dots just underneath my skin on my hand and feet which is staying for 5-7days and going away leaving faint black spots. I again showed it to the same doctor. He is confident and repeatedly asked me to stop worrying. He also gave me anti-anxiety, anti-OCD, anti-depressant drugs.I am also taking sessions with a psychologist. But still, my mind is not free from the fear of HIV and also fear that my wife and child might get infected by me.My questions are, do I need to repeat any test to out rule the probability of HIV? Are there any probability of error from lab test given the fact that I took the tests twice? Do I need to worry about the window period as there is conflicting information available on the internet? Do I need to worry about the phenomenon of delayed seroconversion? Do I need to opt for the tests from a different lab? Do I need to worry about HIV 1/2anymore? How to unroot the fear from deep inside my mind? Any other opinion on my history?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The chances of transmission of HIV by the given description is almost nil. HIV tests are repeatedly negative and after three months of exposure it is conclusive. You are free from HIV. There is no need for you to worry about seroconversion. You can forget about the episode and lead a normal life. There is no need for any further HIV tests in any lab. Just relax. Do some yoga, exercises, meditation, etc. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Based on your history, it is highly unlikely that you have contracted HIV. The doctor who has seen you twice and ordered multiple tests is confident in his diagnosis that you are not infected. It is normal to experience some anxiety and panic after a possible exposure to HIV, but it is important to trust the medical advice you have received.\n\nThere is a small possibility of a false negative result in any lab test, but the fact that you have taken the tests twice and they have both come back negative indicates that you are negative for HIV. The window period for HIV testing is usually between 4-6 weeks, and you have tested negative at 74 and 110 days post-exposure, which is well beyond the window period. Delayed seroconversion is rare and typically only occurs in people with impaired immune systems.\n\nIt may be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor to work through your fears and anxiety around this experience. Additionally, continuing to see your doctor for regular check-ups and addressing any physical symptoms you may have can also provide reassurance.\n\nIt is important to remember that HIV is not easy to transmit, and with proper protection such as using a condom during sexual activity, the risk of transmission is greatly reduced. Taking care of your physical and mental health is important, and it sounds like you are on the right track with seeing a doctor and therapist.",

About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement. He has had high pressure in that eye previously, but it was mostly lowered by Cyclodiode treatment some eight years ago. The consultant said he had left him on the Azopt drops just as a precaution. My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step.

While it is known that having a family member with schizophrenia increases the risk of developing the disorder, the actual risk varies depending on several factors.\n\nThe risk of developing schizophrenia is estimated to be about 10% for first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child) of an affected individual, compared to 1% in the general population.\n\nHowever, it is important to understand that this does not mean that your boyfriend or your future child will definitely develop schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a relatively rare disorder, and most people who have a family member with the condition do not develop it themselves.\n\nIf you are concerned about your boyfriend's risk of developing schizophrenia or the risk to your future child, you may want to consider consulting with a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor can help you understand the risks and provide information on testing and preventive measures.\n\nIn terms of whether it is risky to marry someone with a family history of schizophrenia, that is ultimately a personal decision that depends on several factors, including your own risk tolerance and your partner's health status. It is important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your concerns and to consider seeking the advice of a mental health professional if needed.",

The IVF process involves using medications to stimulate the ovaries to produce multiple eggs, which are then retrieved and fertilized outside the body. The resulting embryos are then transferred to the uterus, where they may implant and result in pregnancy. As for the delivery, the obstetrician would not typically be able to tell that IVF was used, and a tubal ligation would still be possible if desired.\n\nI recommend discussing your options with your healthcare provider, who can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and individual circumstances.",

        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The skin often darkens due to tanning under the effect of UV (ultraviolet) rays. I would strongly recommend using a sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30. The sunscreen has to be applied at least half an hour before you go out and has to be reapplied every four hours till evening. I suggest trying skin lightening cream like Biluma (Kojic acid) at night. Alternatively, you could visit your dermatologist for chemical peels like Lactic acid or Glycolic acid peels.

Protect your skin from the sun: Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day, even when it's cloudy outside. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your face from the sun.\n\n2. Treat hyperpigmentation: You can use over-the-counter creams and serums that contain ingredients like hydroquinone, kojic acid, or vitamin C to reduce hyperpigmentation and even out your skin tone. However, it's important to use these products as directed and consult with a dermatologist if you have any concerns.\n\n3. Exfoliate regularly: Exfoliation can help remove dead skin cells and reveal brighter, smoother skin. You can use a gentle scrub, a chemical exfoliant like glycolic acid, or a facial brush.\n\n4. Maintain a healthy diet: Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help improve your skin's health and appearance. Foods like tomatoes, citrus fruits, and leafy greens contain antioxidants and vitamins that can help reduce inflammation and promote skin health.\n\n5. Seek professional help: If home remedies don't work, you can consider visiting a dermatologist who can assess your skin concerns and recommend treatments like chemical peels or laser therapy.\n\nRemember, restoring your skin's original color may take time, patience, and consistency, and it's important to take a holistic approach by protecting your skin from the sun, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and seeking professional help if needed.",

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. It could be a miscarriage and could be spotting in early pregnancy as miscarriages are usually confirmed on ultrasound scan and bleeding is heavy with abdominal pain and it usually takes a few days before getting stopped. I would suggest you to repeat a pregnancy test and see if it is positive or not because if pregnancy is miscarrying then there is a possibility for that to become negative due to falling levels of hCG.  Take care.",

The bleeding after sex could be due to a few different reasons including implantation bleeding or a cervical issue. The cramping could also be indicative of implantation or it could be due to other reasons such as gastrointestinal issues or a urinary tract infection. The hCG level of 150 is on the lower side, but it is still possible that you are in the early stages of pregnancy. A follow-up blood test and repeat ultrasound may be recommended to see if the hCG is rising and to assess the pregnancy further.

If there is an infection causing your dental pain then your painkiller gives only symptomatic relief, but your dental infection will still be present. Excess intake of any medication (such as painkiller) may be harmful. Many dental pain needs treatment as well as medication. Only medication gives you symptomatic relief.

Based on what you have shared, you are within the recommended dose range for Advil. However, taking Advil for an extended period of time can also increase the risk of side effects.

They are perfectly normal. It occurs earlier in myopes or people using minus power glasses. They are a matter of concern only if you see a sudden shower of floaters.

Seeing small dots or floaters in the field of vision is a common occurrence, and it can happen to anyone. The tiny dots may look like specks, dark spots, or floating threads, and they typically move with the movement of the eyes. It is usually harmless and can occur due to the natural changes that happen in the vitreous gel inside the eyeball as we age, which is called vitreous liquefaction.\n\nIt is good that you have visited an eye doctor to have your eyes checked, and if they have found no issues, you can try some simple measures to minimize the effect of floaters. For example, looking up or down, blinking, or moving your eyes rapidly may help to shift the floaters out of your field of vision. If the floaters are affecting your vision significantly or you're experiencing other symptoms like flashes of light or loss of vision, it is important to seek further medical advice from an eye specialist as they may indicate a more serious underlying condition.",

It will be best if she can take the lamotrigine again as it is helping her a lot. If she is unable to tolerate the lamotrigine then other alternatives like bupropion or trazodone could help. However, these medications are not approved for use in bipolar disorder. Ketamine might also help but only temporarily. If she has a history of addiction then going back to ketamine might not be feasible. I hope this helps! Take care"

However, it is possible but rare to get pregnant without sperm being released, for example, if sperm are present on fingers or other objects and are then introduced to the vagina.\n\nTo confirm pregnancy, you can take a pregnancy test. These can be purchased at most drugstores and can detect the pregnancy hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), in your urine. You can use a home pregnancy test or have your healthcare provider do a blood test.\n\nHowever, if you have concerns about a possible pregnancy or any symptoms that may be related to a pregnancy, I advise you to schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding abortion, I highly recommend talking with your healthcare provider and getting proper medical advice. There are both surgical and non-surgical options for abortion, and the type of abortion that is recommended may depend on factors such as how far along the pregnancy is and your medical history. It is important to seek medical care from a qualified healthcare provider, as self-induced abortion can be dangerous and is not recommended.",

However, ever since I started the second pack, I have been having spotting and later with breakthrough bleeding.So I decided to stop my second pack at the 11th pill to have my period (so together with the previous pill pack, I took 34 active pills before I stopped taking for a period).

Breakthrough bleeding is a common side effect of birth control pills, especially in the first few months of use. However, it is always a good idea to use extra contraception (such as a condom) when you have sex during the first 7 days of starting a new pack, as the pill may not have fully taken effect yet. After 7 days of taking the pill correctly, it should provide reliable contraceptive protection.",

You have taken the second pack with the period days, so there was no need to take a break between the two packs. Since you did not take the last pill of the second pack, you may have missed out some hormonal protection. This could be one reason for your bleeding. Also, you should have used condoms for additional protection."

The medication contains isotretinoin, which is known to cause gastrointestinal side effects such as stomach pain, nausea, and acid reflux. The burning sensation in your stomach might be one of the side effects of Cutein.

It is effective in reducing the symptoms of acid reflux, gastritis, and other stomach problems.

        "input": "Hi doctor,My fiance and I were fooling around yesterday and I had semen smeared all over my vagina. He was not wearing a condom. We did not have penetrative sex. However, after the encounter, I got nervous and got emergency pills. All this happened about 14 days after my last period. I assumed I was highly fertile and was at risk for pregnancy. P2, I took one about three hours after my vagina was smeared with semen. I took the next pill 12 hours after the first. Here are my questions:1. I really do not want a pregnancy right now. Is it wise if I take a second dose of the pill to completely reduce chances of implantation? Is it safe to take a higher dose of pills to completely eradicate any possibility of pregnancy?2. What else can I do to make sure I am completely out of the woods?3. Also, after seven days, is it okay for me to start taking antibiotics to eradicate any infections passed? Can general antibiotics like Amoxil treat the treatable STI?4. When is the most prudent time to take an HIV test?5. How effective is P2 when taken during ovulation? I did a little research and some said that P2 will not help if it is taken during ovulation. 6. How can I (in case I get pregnant) make the uterus inhospitable for the growth of the embryo? 7. When should I take a pregnancy test?8. What is the safest mode of getting rid of a fertilised egg within the first few weeks?9. My period should be in two weeks or 15 days from now. Is it guarantee that if it delays I am pregnant? Is it also possible for me to have my period yet still be pregnant?10. Lastly, what are the chances in terms of percentage that I might be pregnant without necessarily having penetrative intercourse?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. How are you doing? That is a lot of questions, but all leading to the same answer. An emergency pill is high dose Progesterone, best taken within three days of sex. Best results if taken within 24 hours of sex. Being a high dose Progesterone, the uterine lining becomes very unfavorable for a possible embryo implantation. The lining suddenly becomes very thick. As it is a single dose, the lining cannot stand on its own and it falls off. But you rightly said success depends on which phase of the cycle you took it. If ovulation had just occurred that day, still there are equal chances of pregnancy and miscarriage. About the questions: 1. You should have the second dose. It will improve chance of embryo not getting implanted. 2. Only after you reach the other end you can confirm that you are out of the woods. You will have to wait for the period. 3. You can have antibiotics anyday, Azithromycin, Doxycycline would be a better choice. 4. HIV can be tested any time now and after six months repeated. 5 and 6 already answered. 7. The pregnancy test can be done earliest one day after the expected period. 8. If positive, you will need a scan to confirm intrauterine pregnancy after two weeks, then MTP (medical termination of pregnancy) can be used. 9. Emergency pill disturbs the hormones, so only the pregnancy test will give you some information. 10. Sperms can swim up even from your thighs into the vagina, so the chance of pregnancy is still there. ",

ECPs are already a high dose of hormones. Taking it more than the recommended dose would not further reduce the chance of pregnancy.\n\n2. Emergency contraceptive pills have shown to be highly effective in preventing pregnancy when taken correctly, but it does not provide protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you are concerned about STIs, you should consult your healthcare provider.\n\n3. If you are diagnosed with an STI, your healthcare provider can prescribe an appropriate antibiotic.

It is not recommended to intentionally try to make the uterus inhospitable for the growth of an embryo, as it can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening.\n\n7. The recommended time to take a pregnancy test is after a missed period. However, if you are concerned, you can take a test after 3 weeks of the unprotected encounter.\n\n8. It is not recommended to try to get rid of a fertilized egg. If you suspect you may be pregnant, you should consult with your healthcare provider for options and support.\n\n9. A late period can indicate pregnancy, but it is not a guarantee as periods can be delayed for various reasons. Similarly, it is possible to experience bleeding during pregnancy, but it is not a period.\n\n10. Without penetrative intercourse, the chances of pregnancy are lower, but it is not impossible as pre-ejaculate can contain sperm.

If Flexon MR (Ibuprofen, Paracetamol, and Chlorzoxazone) and muscle exercises are not resolving the problem then an X-ray of the tooth should be done to check for any infection. It can heal mostly within a week. No, it cannot become permanent and both conditions - infection and muscle spasm are treatable. For more information consult a dentist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nIt is possible that the pain and limited jaw movement you are experiencing is due to a muscle spasm unrelated to your root canal treatment. This is usually caused by muscle tension or strain in the jaw area, which can lead to discomfort and difficulty opening the mouth.\n\nThe treatment you are currently receiving is appropriate, including taking Flexon MR and doing a few muscle exercises. You should continue this and also try to avoid overusing the muscles in the jaw area, such as chewing gum, constant talking or yelling. Additionally, you can use warm compresses to help reduce muscle tension and ease pain.\n\nA muscle spasm usually resolves on its own within a few days to a week. However, in some cases, it may take longer to heal. If your symptoms persist for more than a week or become more severe, it’s best to consult your dentist or doctor again for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that it is unlikely for this to become a permanent problem. With proper care and treatment, the muscle spasm should resolve completely.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  As you have undergone Root Canal Treatment, the cause of your problem can be either due to the procedure or due to any other reason. The most common cause of problem after the root canal would be due to the infection around the root tip called as Periapical Abscess. This usually occurs if there is an incomplete removal of the infected tissue during the course of treatment. You should consult a Dentist and get the radiograph taken along with a clinical examination. Your symptoms may be due to some infection around the root tip which needs to be treated by means of antibiotics and surgery. Hope this helps you. Regards"

I have not fully missed a period but had a very light period a little over a week ago, it was way darker than normal also very light and lasted for maybe two days. Which is odd because I have been taking birth control for almost three years now so my period has become very regular and the same consistency each time. Also another weird thing, since I am curious if I am with child or not, I have stopped taking my birth control, and as you should know, when you stop taking it the next day you bleed.

One can go with full mouth case with dental implants when the underlying bone conditions are ideal, which means patient\\s boney ridge should have adequate height and width.

Is the result of 120 days test accurate? Please provide information as I am suffering from lots of tensions. I gained weight in the last two months. I have stretch marks on my body with pimples and headaches. There is a blood vessel break in my eyes and it is like a red dot. Should I get a test for HIV again? Or else should I relax?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Antibodies are the proteins produced by the body in response to fight the foreign substance (antigen, virus, infectious agent) it enters the body. When antigen enters the body, it stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. It is very difficult to tell that how much time a particular person takes to develop antibodies. Your negative HIV antibody test at 120 days means that 99.9% of your body has not been exposed to HIV. The test kits used these days are highly sensitive and specific and give accurate results.120 days HIV negative test is highly conclusive of your negative HIV status. But, I think that you are not letting it go. The symptoms are more likely due to stress. There are very rare cases reported in the literature where the person has been exposed to antigen but the time taken by the body to produce detectable antibodies was longer, up to six months. There are recommendations and I also suggest to my patients to repeat the test at six months and if that will be negative you need not repeat it further. I hope this helps. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello there. I am sorry to hear about your concerns regarding HIV. \n\nTo answer your first question, most individuals who contract HIV produce detectable antibodies within 4 to 6 weeks of exposure. In rare cases, it may take up to 3 months for antibodies to be detectable. The tridot test is a reliable test for HIV antibodies, and a negative result at 120 days is considered to be conclusive. So, based on your negative results, it is unlikely that you have HIV.\n\nAs for your other concerns, HIV is a manageable condition with appropriate medical care. People with HIV can live long and healthy lives with access to antiretroviral therapy. It is important to get regular medical check-ups and follow the recommended treatment plan if diagnosed with HIV.\n\nYour symptoms such as weight gain, stretch marks, and headaches may not be directly related to HIV. These symptoms can be caused by a variety of other conditions, including stress and lifestyle factors. Red dots in your eyes may be caused by a blood vessel break, which is usually harmless but can be a sign of high blood pressure or other underlying medical conditions.

Kell antigen can be antigenic and can create a problem during a blood transfusion or else it may not create any problem. So there is no need for having a specific treatment. Whenever your child requires a blood transfusion, the blood bank should find the right blood suitable for your child as per cross match report.

I understand that this can be scary and overwhelming for you, but please know that there are steps that can be taken to help ensure the safety of your babies.\n\nKell incompatibility occurs when a mother has antibodies to the Kell blood group antigen, which can harm the fetus who has inherited the Kell antigen from the father. It can cause hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), a condition that can lead to anemia, jaundice, and in severe cases, neurological damage or even stillbirth.\n\nHaving a Kell group present in your blood means that there's a chance that you can pass the Kell antigen to your babies. The good news is that since your partner has already received a transfusion, she has likely built up antibodies that can protect your babies from HDFN.\n\nHowever, it's still important to monitor the babies' health closely throughout the pregnancy. Your partner will need to have regular ultrasounds to check for signs of anemia and other complications. If the babies develop HDFN, they may need treatment such as intrauterine transfusions or early delivery.\n\nThe long-term effects for babies affected by HDFN can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Some may have no lasting effects, while others may have developmental delays or other complications. It's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to manage the condition and minimize any potential risks.\n\nIn summary, it is important that your partner receive proper medical care throughout the pregnancy and monitor the health of the babies closely. Your healthcare provider will recommend appropriate measures if the babies develop HDFN. With careful management, it's possible for your babies to have a healthy life.",

This means that your body is producing antibodies against these antigens, which may attack the red blood cells of your children. However, as this is not a serious condition, it does not cause any long-term damage to the fetus or child. 2) The best way to avoid the problem is to receive blood from someone who doesn't have the antigen. You should get tested for other groups, such as Rhesus (Rh), Duffy, MNS, C, E, Kidd, etc., as well as the Kell group. 3) If you do happen to have the same antigen, then you will need to get immunoglobulin therapy during labor. 4) Regardless of what your blood type is, you should always use Rh positive blood when donating plasma or platelets."

However, over the next couple weeks the numbing, tingling, moved to my right arm then my legs and feet to include muscle twitching/ spasms. Now, these symptoms have mostly left my arms other than occasional slight sensation in my fingers. However, my legs and left foot continue to have this sensation. I do not have any pain other than the sensation and can move normally. However, exerting myself seems to elevate the sensation. I visited my doctor and they ran a complete set of lab work and everything was normal other than slightly low vitamin D. Also scheduled to MRI on the spine to rule out MS.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can mimic this clinical situation.

Additionally, there are supplements such as B complex vitamins, alpha-lipoic acid, and omega-3 fatty acids that may help.

It is like it got stuck in one place. It does not move up and down when I put my finger. It is just fixed up in one place and the tinnitus has also gone bad.

Secondly, it is placed 2.5 cm from external ear orifice and cannot be moved with a finger. Since you had a perforation two years back, it might not have healed at all.

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your ear health concerns. Ear perforations usually take about 6-8 weeks to heal completely, so if your perforation was only two months ago, it is possible that it has not fully healed yet. However, it sounds like your ear may have gotten worse after the ear syringing and earwax clean up. \n\nEar syringing can sometimes cause trauma to the ear canal, and it's possible that this may have affected your eardrum. It's also possible that excess water or debris was forced into your ear canal, which may have caused further damage to your eardrum or ear canal. \n\nI would recommend seeing an ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) doctor or an audiologist as soon as possible to have your ear examined. They may recommend a hearing test to assess the extent of damage to your eardrum and the surrounding structures. Depending on the severity of the damage, the doctor may recommend further treatment options such as antibiotic drops, corticosteroids, or in some cases, surgical intervention. \n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend avoiding putting any objects in your ear, including your fingers, as this may aggravate the condition. If you are experiencing pain or discharge from your ear, you may use over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label and consult with your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nI understand that this can be a worrying time for you, but with proper medical attention and care, your eardrum may heal again. Please do not hesitate to seek medical advice as soon as you can.",

A CT scan of the temporal bone can help determine if there is any cause of the stiffness of the tympanic membrane.5. If there is any obstruction then treatment depends on the site of the obstruction-if it is due to wax accumulation then you can use warm water irrigation followed by gentle suctioning.6. If there is any other pathology then surgery may be needed.7. Please do visit an ENT specialist and get evaluated. Hope this helps"

I have uploaded a copy of the blood test reports and ECG was done for the follow-up on eighth of this month. Yesterday too he had to do a confirmatory blood test (Troponin) as well as ECG which confirmed he had a silent heart attack 10 days back.

The causes of IBS are not fully understood, but it is believed to be a combination of several factors. Some of these factors include:\n\n1. Changes in the gut microbiome: The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms that live in the digestive tract. Changes in the composition or diversity of these microorganisms can contribute to the development of IBS.\n\n2. Food sensitivities: Certain foods can trigger IBS symptoms, particularly FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). FODMAPs are a group of carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine and can lead to gas, bloating, and diarrhea.\n\n3. Stress and emotional factors: Stress and anxiety can worsen IBS symptoms, and many people with IBS report that their symptoms are triggered by emotional factors.\n\n4. Abnormalities in the nervous system: Abnormalities in the way the brain and the gut communicate with each other can lead to IBS.\n\n5. Muscle contractions in the intestine: Abnormal muscle contractions in the intestine, which can be caused by hormonal imbalances, medications or other factors, can contribute to IBS.\n\nThere is no cure for IBS, but it can be effectively managed with lifestyle changes and medication. The management of IBS usually involves diet modification, stress management, regular exercise, and medication.

Take care.",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello, first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block is a delay in the electrical conduction of the heart through the AV node, which can be detected on an ECG. It is usually an asymptomatic, benign condition, and does not require any specific treatment. It means that the electrical signal from the upper chamber of the heart (atria) is delayed slightly as it passes through the AV node before it reaches the lower chamber of the heart (ventricles).\n\nThe cause of first-degree AV block can vary and may be present in normal individuals without any underlying heart disease. However, it can also occur as a result of certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, metabolic disorders or structural heart issues. If there is an underlying heart disease, like coronary artery disease, hypertension, or myocarditis, it may need to be addressed.\n\nTherefore, if there are any underlying symptoms, medical conditions or abnormalities found during physical examination, additional tests or investigations may be needed to determine the cause of the first-degree AV block. In general, treatment is not required for first-degree AV block, but it is important to monitor any symptoms, and the condition should be followed up with regular appointments with your healthcare provider.",

This is caused by a problem with the pathway for these impulses to pass through. It can be either congenital or acquired and may be due to a number of causes including medications, electrolyte imbalances etc. Treatment depends upon the underlying cause. You should consult a cardiologist who will examine you and order tests like EKG, echocardiogram and blood tests along with an exercise stress test if necessary to determine the cause and treatment."

I saw one endodontist who said to rule out implant and he would do root canal but bone and gum are less than ideal and 50-50 chances are there that it will work. He also did not clear all the decay, did not take the crown off but drills straight through. (A wobbly decayed tooth underneath crown?), did not do the post or crown. There is a long standing chronic abcess at root for years. Current root canal was done 7 years ago. I do not have any other molars left in lower. I am in shocked, sad, anxious and 60 years old.I feel tempted to go to an unknown dentist just to see if he could do a hemisection as the Endodontist I talk to \"no longer do them as implants are available and hemis tend not to last long\". Does anyone reading this please see any hope for this tooth? I chew on it and have no sensitivity and no pain; no symptoms at all. There is gum recession I have complained to dentist about for the last couple of years. I am concerned I will regret not trying to save this tooth if at all possible. Also told to see prosthodontist to ensure a crown could be made if I get the retreatment. I have two tracks I am pursuing.

Concerned in this decision making process about any further damage being done to gum and or bone. Impeccable hygiene history.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. Seeing the recent X-rays (attachment removed to protect patient identity) it is obvious that the distal root has abscess and should be removed. Hemisection might be a good idea but it alone cannot withstand the biting force and if you can afford, then go for a molar implant behind this tooth so that you will get one extra molar to chew on. A hemisection to retain the mesial root of this tooth along with another implant behind it will give adequate tooth structure to have a normal biting force. If you cannot afford both then go for extraction of this abscessed tooth and an implant as hemisection alone is not strong unless it has more support behind it. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your situation. From the X-rays you attached, it appears that there is significant decay and bone loss around the affected tooth. While it may be possible to save the tooth with a root canal and a new crown, it may be a risky procedure given the current condition of the tooth and the surrounding bone.\n\nThe endodontist you saw may have recommended an implant because it tends to be a more reliable long-term solution for replacing missing teeth, especially when the surrounding bone and gum tissue are compromised. That being said, any decision regarding treatment should take into account your individual goals and preferences, as well as the risks and benefits of each option.\n\nIt's good that you are seeking out different opinions from specialists like oral surgeons and prosthodontists. They can help provide a more comprehensive evaluation of your situation and recommend the best course of action. In the end, the decision about how to manage your tooth will ultimately be up to you, but I would strongly recommend giving careful thought to each option and talking with your dental team about any concerns or questions you may have.\n\nBest of luck, and please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. The treatment plan should be discussed with your treating dentist. If the tooth can be saved by doing root canal treatment, it would be better to do it rather than going for extraction. If the tooth is irreversibly damaged due to periodontitis, it can be extracted and replaced with implant or fixed bridge. You need to consult an oral surgeon first to find out the status of the tooth. As per the clinical examination, if the tooth can be saved, then root canal treatment should be done followed by placement of crown over it. Hope this helps."

I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row. The EP I saw in the hospital prescribed me Flecainide 50 mg, twice daily. I saw another EP, who was a much older guy, as a second opinion. He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation. I do not agree with him on the ablation due to recent medical studies on WPW and how ablation is recommended even for asymptomatic patients, especially athletes.My question is regarding Flecainide. I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW.

Therefore, it is essential to monitor the heart rhythm with continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring while taking Flecainide.\n\nThe decision to take Flecainide or any medication prior to ablation should be made based on the individual patient's risk-benefit analysis and discussed with your treating physician. The EP who prescribed the medication might have first-hand information about your condition and deemed it necessary to prescribe.\n\nAdditionally, a Flecainide overdose can cause adverse side effects, including palpitations, which limits its use to strictly clinical settings where there is constant monitoring of patients' conditions.\n\nIt is crucial to have a follow-up with your treating physician to monitor your heart rhythm on the medication and adjust the dosage as needed to avoid significant risk of developing more dangerous rhythms. \n\nPlease note that if you have any side effects or palpitations, you should seek immediate medical attention.\n\nBest regards.",

I rushed in and drank water, but it felt like the damage was done. Today I am struggling with eating and drinking. The pain down the center of my body is excruciating when I swallow something. I am having constant pain in the middle of my chest and back, sort of under my ribs, and the back of my throat feels like I have the worse sore throat ever. I feel sick all the time.

These symptoms can include anxiety, insomnia, sweating, heart palpitations, and tinnitus.

To give you some context, I went abroad for studies, and I felt extremely lonely and miserable there. After a year, I was suffering from sleep problems. However, one day, I had confusing thoughts, just before I went to sleep. For some reason, I became convinced that I had a mental illness, and I began researching my symptoms. My condition also declined. I began to feel detached from everyone and everything around me, and I felt like I was losing touch with reality. This went on for some months. However, during this time, I felt fine when I was in the company of others, and therefore longed to be with people and talk to them.I gave my exams, even rejoined a job, which I had left to do my masters. There are periods when I feel completely fine. But, there are periods when I feel terrible. I am having the following symptoms. Whatever dreams I have, I tend to remember and notice them more. I could be dreaming about my old house or someone. So when I wake up, these dreams cause me to feel uncomfortable, like maybe I will lose my grip on reality. Whenever I see or meet a person I have dreamt about, I get an uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling and a memory of the dream. This makes me afraid that maybe I will be unable to distinguish between dreams and reality.I get mental images and thoughts of memories or things I dreamt about. This gives a very unpleasant feeling.

        "input": "Hello doctor, I am 29 years old. I had my tubes tied nearly four years ago but have been displaying symptoms of pregnancy for two months including weight gain in my stomach, nausea, sore breasts fluttering abnormal feelings in my stomach. It is believed I had a miscarriage nearly four months ago due to the sudden onset of my period and the extreme pain that was contributed to it.My cycles usually came to between one and two set days and last for four to five days with a heavier flow. Recently they have been sporadic in their comings lasting anywhere from two to seven days with a lighter flow and a change in color with no clotting as used to be normal. I went to my gynecologist after the first incident and as per him, my cervix was soft and sensitive causing me discomfort when applying pressure.My stomach now is still the same with a harder to touch feel with pain in my lower right hip side that radiates up towards the bottom of my ribs lasting seconds to minutes and recurring frequently. I have taken an OTC test that has came back negative and my blood pressure has been very low ranging around 83/67 mmHg. Can you please help me to figure out what is going on?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello.  With the description you have given, I understand that with the tubal ligation done four years ago and the urine pregnancy test negative and you are having your menses each month (bleeding lasting between 2-7 days), with heaviness and pain over the right iliac region and off and on extending towards the ribs indicate an ovarian cause. It could be possibly a developing ovarian cyst which is duly enlarging in size. Oligo and hypomenorrhea are a feature in such cases. This is definitely not pregnancy. Ovarian cysts are known to produce estrogenic symptoms like sore tender breasts, nausea and bloating sensation as well. The softness of the cervix could be attributed to the same. My advice would be to undergo a pelvic ultrasound at the earliest to rule out right-sided ovarian cyst formation or probably an endometrioma accompanied. The size would further decide the course of treatment. you may contact me for further opinion.  Take care.",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Based on your symptoms and history, there are a few possibilities to consider. It is possible that you may be experiencing a hormonal imbalance which can result in irregular periods, weight gain, and other symptoms that mimic pregnancy. Another possibility is that you may have developed an ovarian cyst or fibroid, which can cause abdominal pain and changes in menstrual flow.\n\nRegarding your low blood pressure, this may be unrelated but it is important to monitor and discuss with your healthcare provider. It is important to follow up with your gynecologist for further evaluation and possible imaging studies such as ultrasound to identify any structural abnormalities. Additionally, your healthcare provider may recommend hormonal testing or further diagnostic tests to identify the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\nIt is also important to discuss with your healthcare provider about the possibility of ectopic pregnancy, as this can be a serious medical condition that requires immediate treatment. Please seek medical attention promptly if you experience severe pelvic pain or vaginal bleeding.\n\nOverall, it is important to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider as there may be several potential causes for your symptoms.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) The symptoms you describe could be related to hormonal imbalance. 2) The fact that your periods are irregular may be another sign that something is not quite right. 3) You should get a thyroid function test done to exclude any possible thyroid dysfunction.4) A urine pregnancy test would also be useful.5) If everything comes back normal, then there may be some sort of pelvic inflammatory disease or even ovarian cyst which needs investigation.

Without seeing your MRI images or examining you personally, this is a difficult question to answer. However, here are some general guidelines:\n\n- Rest is critical, and you must follow your doctor's recommended treatment plan. Failure to do so can lead to long-term shoulder instability, pain, and stiffness.\n- After being immobilized for six months or so, your physician may request another MRI to see if the Hill-Sachs lesion has healed or progressed. This would be the best way to assess improvement, and your doctor may make further recommendations based on the findings.\n- A physical therapist can guide you as to when and how to reintegrate exercise or activity once you become cleared by your doctor. These professionals can provide stretching, strengthening, and range-of-motion exercises tailored to your needs.\n- Documenting your progress through a diary or journal, recording any unusual pain or symptoms, can aid in tracking how well the healing process is progressing.\n\nIn short, follow your physician's advice and obtain any necessary follow-up appointments or imaging.

Some possible causes of non-obstructive azoospermia (the absence of sperm in semen) include genetic issues, hormonal imbalances, testicular injury or damage, or an autoimmune disorder. In some cases, lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking or reducing alcohol consumption may help improve sperm production. However, if there is an underlying medical condition, medical or surgical treatment may be necessary. Additionally, some men may benefit from assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or testicular sperm extraction (TESE).\n\nUltimately, it's impossible to predict whether you will be able to produce sperm in the future.

Look for one that is oil-free and fragrance-free, as fragrances can irritate your skin and aggravate your acne. Some good brands to try are Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Dove.\n\n2. Apply a topical acne treatment: There are several over-the-counter treatments that can help to clear up acne, such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and alpha hydroxy acids. Apply the product to your back as directed, and avoid using too much or applying it too often, as this can dry out your skin and make your acne worse.\n\n3.

Be gentle with your skin, however, as over-exfoliating can cause irritation and inflammation.\n\n4. Don't pick at your acne: It can be tempting to pick at your acne, but this can make it worse and can lead to scarring. Try to avoid touching your back as much as possible, and if you absolutely must pick at your acne, use clean tools and be gentle.\n\n5. Visit a dermatologist: If your acne is severe or doesn't respond to over-the-counter treatments, it's best to see a dermatologist. They can prescribe stronger medications or recommend other treatments, such as laser therapy.\n\nOverall, acne can be difficult to manage, but with a good skincare routine and some patience, you should be able to get it under control.

I'm sorry to hear that you have to wait four months to see a neurologist. It's good to hear that your blood tests and MRI scans are clear. However, ongoing muscle twitching can be distressing and it's important to get a proper evaluation to determine the underlying cause.\n\nIt's possible that your muscle twitches are related to stress or anxiety since you have been under significant stress lately. It's also possible that your medications, such as Nexium and the contraceptive pill, may be contributing to your symptoms.

        "input": "Hello doctor,About a week ago, I got off the lounge chair and felt a sharp pain in the back of my left ankle. The pain has not changed during the week. The whole ankle is still swollen.  The pain has not changed, and it radiates from inside the heels up to my Achilles and into the lower back part of my leg.  I can hardly walk. Three days ago I went to the hospital, wherein a portable ultrasound scan of the Achilles\\ tendon was performed, which revealed that it was still intact, but the doctors said it could be torn. About eight months back, I had an accident at the workplace and had torn my L5/S1 disc. And this had created a leaking disc and a bulge affecting the nerves in my legs. I had a nerve conduction test done, and the results were positive with nerve issues in my left leg, but I never had this pain before in this part of my foot. I have attached a photo of the back of my ankle, and you can see the Achilles\\ tendon is badly swollen. When it is strapped, it is a little better, but still painful. When it is unstrapped it is worse, and I can hardly walk on it. What do you think my injury is? Could it be related to my back and nerve injury? What treatment is available and what should I do now?",

        "answer_chatgpt": "Based on your description, it is possible that you have sustained an injury to your Achilles tendon, such as a partial tear or inflammation. The swelling and pain you are experiencing can also be related to the nerve issues in your left leg caused by your previous back injury.\n\nYou may require imaging studies, such as an MRI or CT scan, to further evaluate the extent of your injury. Treatment will depend on the severity of your condition and may include physical therapy, immobilization of the leg, anti-inflammatory or pain medications, corticosteroid injections, and in severe cases, surgery.\n\nIt is important that you consult your physician or a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan as soon as possible to prevent further complications. In the meantime, avoid putting weight on the affected leg and keep it elevated to help reduce the swelling.\n\nI hope you find this information helpful, and I wish you a speedy recovery.",

I don't know if you have undergone any MRI or CT scan of the area, but if not then you need to get it done as soon as possible. In case there is no major damage then immobilization in a cast and physiotherapy will help you recover faster. In case of complete rupture surgery might be needed. Hope this helps you and take care"

I had once consulted a skin specialist to check if there are any options to get this removed. I was told that even if it is removed by surgical means there are chances that it may reappear. I want to confirm this. Do we have any options to remove it by surgical or nonsurgical means? Are there laser treatments available? Will I have to remove my hair if I need to undergo treatment? I have attached a photograph of the affected area.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have seen the photo. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  I understand your concern. The condition is known as nevus sebaceous. In case of deep surgical excision in nevus sebaceous, chances of it coming back are very less. The thing is the excision should be deep to minimize the chances of recurrences. Laser treatments are there but not very effective and chances of recurrences are more. Hair needs to be removed as the area should be devoid of it to perform surgery. Cost depends on the different doctors and their location or specialty. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! From the photograph that you have shared, it appears to be a pigmented nevus or mole. These are usually benign growths that are present on the skin from birth. Although surgical removal is an option, the chances of complete removal and reoccurrence of the mole cannot be completely ruled out.\n\nLaser treatment can also be considered for this type of birthmark. Laser treatment uses light energy to remove the unwanted pigmentation. Multiple sessions of laser treatment may be required to achieve the desired results. Depending on the type of laser used, hair removal may or may not be necessary. Your dermatologist can guide you on this based on your skin and hair type.\n\nOverall, it is advisable to consult a dermatologist for a detailed evaluation and to plan the best treatment option for you based on the site, size, and type of birthmark.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hey thanks for writing in and sharing your concern with us. I understand your query. It is good that you have got an opinion from a dermatologist regarding your condition. This is not uncommon. Black spots can be present over the body due to many reasons. And they do recur after removal. The only way to get rid of them permanently is through excision surgery which involves cutting out the lesion along with a margin of healthy tissue around it. Lasers cannot be used for such lesions as they are benign. You will have to take care while shaving the area. You should avoid shaving over the spot. This spot could be a nevus, a mole or a melanoma. These types of lesions are all benign but if they are changing appearance, growing in size or color then you must see a dermatologist."

However, any medication can have potential side effects and interactions with anesthesia or pain management. It is always important to inform your surgeon and anesthesia team of any medications you are taking, including Zoloft.\n\nGiven your concerns and the timing of your surgery, it may be best to delay starting Zoloft until after your surgery.

If your anxiety is not controlled by SSRIs then benzodiazepines can be used as they also have lesser chances of bleeding but again should be started at least 7 days before surgery.

Heart attacks occur due to various causes related to all systems of the body. So inheritance does not play any role here.

But if you wear glasses or contact lenses, it will help improve vision. The progression of myopia slows down after puberty and stabilizes at around age 20. So, if you stop wearing glasses, there will not be much change in your refractive error. However, if you do not want to wear spectacles, then you could go for surgical correction like LASIK or PRK. These surgeries remove tissue from the cornea to correct refractive errors. You need to consult an ophthalmologist for detailed evaluation before proceeding with such procedures. Hope this helps."

Now, my partner and I are trying to conceive. I had a semen analysis and the results were not great. The worst part is the morphology. Only 2 % of my sperms are formed normally. The rest are abnormal. So my two questions are: is it possible that the chlamydia is the cause of this? Can chlamydia cause permanent problems for male fertility? Is there anything I can do to increase this percentage? I am taking vitamins and exercising. I am soon going to cut out sugars and watch my diet. Will this help? Are there other things we can do? Lastly, the evaluation said I have a \\poor prognosis\\ in terms of my morphology.

However, I can give you general information that might help answer some of your questions.\n\nChlamydia infection can damage the male reproductive system, causing inflammation in the epididymis, testes, and vas deferens. This damage can result in low sperm count and abnormal sperm morphology (shape). Chronic chlamydia infection can also lead to scarring and blockage of the tubes that carry sperm from the testes to the penis, which can result in infertility.\n\nIt is possible that your chlamydia infection may have contributed to your current abnormal sperm morphology.\n\nChanges in lifestyle, such as exercise and a healthy diet, can have a positive effect on sperm health. A study conducted by the University of Utah found that men who had a healthy diet had better sperm motility and morphology. Avoiding smoking and recreational drugs can also improve sperm health.\n\nIUI involves injecting washed and concentrated motile sperm into the uterus, which can increase the chance of fertilization. The success rates of IUI vary depending on factors such as age and the severity of male factor infertility. According to several studies, the success rate of IUI is typically between 10 and 20% per treatment cycle.\n\nIt is recommended that you consult with a fertility specialist, who can help you determine the cause of your infertility and recommend the best treatment options.

I did a CBCT and it shows a cyst and sinusitis although I have not that much pain. I am 41 and the dentist told me that I have bone resorption at the upper left maxillary region and I also have been recently diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Should I get the tooth extracted? Should I try again for a new third root canal? What about periodontitis which is at the beginning?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. At first, I appreciate you because you have so much awareness of your oral health. The life span of normal root canal treated tooth is 5 to 6 years. If you have 15-year-old treated tooth, it means you are so health conscious and take care of your oral hygiene. My opinion is you should go for extraction along with cyst removal because third-time root canal of the same tooth is not a good idea. Periodontitis is nothing but an infection of gum tissue which is totally curable and depends upon your oral hygiene. Bone resorption is a kind of bone loss due to demineralization. There are many things which are responsible for that like age factor, some diseases, calcium level, gingivitis with periodontitis is also a cause of bone loss. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Based on your description, it seems like your tooth has an unsuccessful root canal treatment and may need to be re-treated or extracted. The CBCT showing a cyst and sinusitis also suggests that there may be an infection present in the region. If left untreated, this infection could spread and cause further damage to surrounding teeth and bone.\n\nIt is also important to address the bone resorption and periodontitis. These can be contributing factors to the unsuccessful root canal and may require treatment to prevent further damage and potential tooth loss.\n\nUltimately, the best course of treatment will depend on several factors, including the severity of the infection and damage to the tooth and surrounding tissues, your overall dental health, and your personal preferences. I would recommend discussing your options with your dentist or an endodontist (a root canal specialist) to determine the best course of action for your individual situation.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Thanks for writing in to us. As per your query, it seems like there is some infection in the area of root canal filling. Firstly as per my opinion I would suggest you to consult an oral surgeon and go for a radiograph and examination of the tooth. Secondly, if the tooth is infected then it should be removed. In case of any infection you should take antibiotics along with anti-inflammatory medication. Do warm saline rinses and lukewarm salt water gargles. You can apply OTC analgesic gel over the affected area. Hope this helps."

        "answer_chatdoctor": " Yes, it is. It can be serious if not treated properly and timely. In this condition, there is decreased production of hemoglobin which causes anemia. The severity of anemia depends upon how much globin is deficient in the body. A child with beta-thalassemia trait may have mild to severe symptoms like fatigue, pallor, weakness, rapid heart rate, etc. So I advise you to get yourself tested for the same. You should avoid marrying someone who has beta-thalassemia trait as your child may inherit the disorder from you."

And now the HSV IGM is positive with 1.15 range along with CMV and rubella IgG positive. Should I wait or can I try to conceive right now? My husband\\s torch panel also done, nothing abnormal.I am currently under Folic acid and Multivitamin, for now, to conceive faster. And also a homeopathic medicine for migraine.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Yes, you can try for your pregnancy as IgG (immunoglobulin G) means that you do not have any current infection. It is only due to prior exposure. And for HSV, the only thing you have to watch is the presence of active lesions. Otherwise, there is no other reason not to try for pregnancy. You must try for it whenever you and your partner feel ready to do so. Secondly, abortion is a very common thing in reproductive age and only after one abortion there is no need to undergo all these extensive investigations. I hope it has helped you. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! I'm sorry to hear about your previous silent missed abortion, and I understand that you are concerned about your Torch panel results.\n\nFirst, let me explain the Torch panel. It is a blood test that checks for several infections that can impact a pregnancy. The test includes four main components: Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV).\n\nI can see that your previous test showed that you were positive for CMV IgG. This means that you have been exposed to the virus in the past and that your body has developed antibodies against it. A positive IgG result is generally not a concern in pregnancy.\n\nRegarding Rubella, I'm glad to see that you were vaccinated after your previous abortion. This will help protect you and your future fetus from Rubella.\n\nNow coming to your current HSV IgM result, I must say that it is of concern. IgM antibodies typically indicate a recent HSV infection, and in the context of trying to conceive, this could be risky. HSV infection during pregnancy can cause problems such as neonatal herpes, which can be severe or even deadly in some cases.\n\nHowever, it's important to keep in mind that HSV IgM results can be a false-positive. This means that the test may show an incorrect positive result. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may recommend further testing.\n\nIn the meantime, it's essential to use safe sex practices to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to your partner. Also, please consult with your healthcare provider about the proper next steps and what this test result could mean for your future pregnancy.\n\nFinally, please continue taking folic acid and a multivitamin to prepare and support a healthy pregnancy. I hope this information helps!",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) You should not be worried about this as the test has only been done once and it may have been positive at other times too.2) You need not worry about your husbands test.3) I would suggest that you should continue with the treatment that you are already taking, and if you get pregnant then you should take all the necessary antibiotics and prophylactic medicines.4) I don't think there is anything wrong in trying to conceive at present."

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. The x-ray power output depends on mAs (milliampere-seconds) and kVp (kilovoltage peak) parameters. The average hip x-ray can be done at about 20 to 30 mAs and 70 to 80 KVp. The general rule is that the percentage increase in mAs causes a similar increase in radiation dose. In your case we can take the average tube current as 25 mAs and dose given to you is 35 mAs. Therefore you might have received 30 to 40 percent over the dose if given a 25 mAs exposure. As x-ray dose for hip x-ray is less when talking about the harmful effects of radiation, so you do not have any significant increase in radiation dose risks. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "The relationship between mAs and dose is not linear, so it is difficult to estimate the exact dose received without more information about the machine used and the technique factors. However, in general, increasing the mAs by 15 units (from average of 20 mAs to 35 mAs) would increase the radiation dose by approximately 50% (from 0.07 mSv to 0.10 mSv).\n\nThis increase in dose may not necessarily be considered an overexposure, as the maximum permissible dose for a single X-ray examination is much higher (typically around 20 mSv) and the actual risk of harm from a single diagnostic X-ray examination is generally low. \n\nNevertheless, it is important to limit the radiation dose as much as possible, so it is recommended to use the lowest effective dose required to obtain the necessary diagnostic information. Your doctor or radiologist may be able to give you more information about the risks and benefits of the examination and the specific dose you received.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "35 mAs is equal to 184 mRads. The amount of radiation exposure from a chest x-ray (for example) varies depending on the size of the image and the thickness of the body part being imaged. For a frontal chest x-ray, the estimated effective dose is about 0.19 millisieverts (mSv). This means that for every 100 chest x-rays done, the person receiving them would receive an average of 19 mSv of radiation."

        "input": "Hello doctor,I want to ask whether composite dental bonding is durable or if I bite a mutton stew or chicken leg piece, it will come out? Is it for a lifetime? If it dismantles anyway, is it freely replaceable or I need to pay again? Also, I have heard that laser treatment leads to early fall of adult teeth in the late 50s. Is it so?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. I had gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Yes, you can eat whatever you want to eat, there is no issue of chewing. Make sure you do not eat any hard substance for the first 24 hours. After that, you can eat mutton or chicken anytime. Better is to go with the best possible restoration provided by your dentist. Less expensive fillings are also available these days but their efficiency is not too good. No, laser curing composite does not affect your teeth or make them prone to fall. If the fillings fall or come out, it will be replaced by your dentist free provided it falls early, if it falls after two or three years it may not be replaced without charges. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Composite dental bonding can be quite durable, but it does have limitations in terms of withstanding heavy biting forces. If you bite into something very hard or chewy, there is a chance that the bonding may come off. However, if you are careful with your chewing and avoid using your teeth as tools, the bonding can last for several years.\n\nThe longevity of dental bonding can also depend on the skill of the dentist performing the procedure, as well as how well you take care of your teeth and dental work after the bonding is placed.\n\nIf the bonding does come off or becomes damaged, it can often be repaired or replaced. However, you may need to pay for this service, especially if the bonding was part of a cosmetic dental procedure.\n\nRegarding your second question, there is no evidence to suggest that laser treatment leads to early loss of adult teeth in your late 50s. Laser treatment can be a safe and effective dental procedure when performed by a licensed dentist, and any potential risks or side effects would be discussed with you prior to the treatment.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) Yes, composite dental bonding can be replaced if it breaks down or wears off but it has to be done by your dentist and not by any other person as it requires skill and expertise.2) I am afraid there is no such thing like laser treatment for early fall of teeth as there is no scientific evidence to back up these claims.3) No one knows why some people lose their teeth early while others may retain them till very old age. There are many factors involved and genetics plays an important role."

I made certain symptoms like hallucinations up. I also exaggerated everything.

In such cases we can use a retainer which will hold the lower jaw forward to close the gap. This procedure has been done successfully by many people and has a high success rate. Hope this helps.

Does it hurt when you chew food or apply pressure on that tooth? When did this start? Any previous history of trauma to that teeth? In case if it is a toothache then you can go for an x-ray and check for any decay or abscess. If the cavity is deep enough then root canal treatment will be needed.

After 13 days of starting the pill, had safe sex with a condom, but we doubt that it broke. To be safe, I took two dosages of Unwanted 72 the next day and stopped regular birth control. After eight days, I got bleeding, and it lasted for five days (same number of days as my regular period after stopping pills every month). What was that bleeding? Was that my normal bleeding or withdrawal? I am confused as this was near to expected period. Then, I did HPT, and it came to be negative. What are my chances of pregnancy? Does this bleeding confirm that I am not pregnant?Somebody suggested that I can start my regular birth control pills and I started. After 10 days, I got my full abdomen ultrasound done. It indicates that no focal lesion was seen and endometrial thickness is 4 mm. Uterus size is 88 mm - 43 mm - 42 mm. Do the thickness and report confirm that I am not pregnant? What is the normal thickness at this stage if I am pregnant? Also, the doctor suggested me to stop birth control pill until I get my regular period. Is that correct?

In early pregnancy, the endometrial lining tends to be thickened, typically measuring around 10 mm or more.\n\nIt's reasonable to start taking your regular birth control pills again, though it's important to use additional contraceptive protection (such as condoms) for at least the first seven days. The advice to wait until your next period to restart the pills is a common recommendation, as it can help to ensure that you start the pills at the optimal time for contraception.\n\nIt's possible that the timing of your next period may be slightly different after taking emergency contraception and restarting birth control pills, but it's generally not a cause for concern.",

Bony restriction in the hip joint, as the hip joint bone gets jammed into socket because of extreme coxa vara angle (angulation between the neck and shaft of the thigh bone) leading to restrictions in movement. These jams will not happen when you do a side split as there is slight rotation occurring in the joint and allows the action to happen.  Other reason could be ligamentous (pubofemoral ligament) limitation as the ligament tightens and it limits the further movement. This ligament realigns and will relax while doing forward and side split. So, it will not restrict your movement other than center split. You can try tilting your pelvis forward so that there can be some relief with limitation in both the cases. For more information consult a physiotherapist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! It sounds like you may be experiencing some hip impingement when attempting the center split. Hip impingement occurs when the bones of the hip joint rub against each other, causing pain and limited range of motion.\n\nThere are a few things you can try to address this issue:\n\n1. Stretch regularly, but gently. Focus on stretching the adductor muscles in your inner thigh and the external rotators of your hip. Avoid forcing yourself into positions that cause pain.\n\n2. Strengthen the muscles around your hip joint. Strengthening exercises, such as clamshells and hip bridges, can help to support the joint and prevent impingement.\n\n3. Adjust your technique when doing the center split. Instead of spreading your legs as wide as possible, try to keep your knees bent and your hips rotated forward. This will help to avoid the impingement and allow for a deeper stretch.\n\n4. Consider consulting a physical therapist. A physical therapist can help you to identify any imbalances or weaknesses in your hip muscles and work with you to develop a personalized plan to address the issue.\n\nIt's important to listen to your body and avoid pushing too hard too fast. With patience and persistence, you can work to improve your center split while avoiding injury.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. The center split you are referring to is called as the \"splitting\" of the leg. This is done by rotating the foot inwards while keeping the knee straight. When you do this, your whole body weight gets transferred to the front side of the knee. This is where the pain originates from. When you rotate the knee backwards and hips forward, the pressure is shifted to the other side and hence the pain reduces. It is possible to reduce the pain through stretching exercises. You should start with gentle stretching of the groin muscles and then gradually move onto full splits. However, if the pain persists even after adequate stretching, you may need to consult a physician who will advise you further investigations like X-ray, MRI etc. In case it is a ligament injury, physical therapy along with medicines will help."

It's difficult to say for sure what may be causing your symptoms without a more thorough examination, but there are a few possibilities that could be causing the pain or discomfort when you yawn.\n\nOne possibility is that you could be experiencing jaw muscle strain or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction. When you yawn, there is an increased demand on the muscles and joints in your jaw, which could cause some pain or discomfort. Similarly, if you are clenching your jaw during the day or grinding your teeth at night, this could also contribute to muscle strain or TMJ problems.\n\nAnother possibility is that you could have a dental issue, such as a cavity or an infection in the root of one of your teeth. These types of issues can also cause pain or discomfort in the jaw area.\n\nI would recommend seeing a dentist or doctor to assess your symptoms and provide a proper diagnosis. They may recommend some imaging tests or refer you to a specialist like a dentist who focuses on TMJ issues. Depending on the cause of your symptoms, they may recommend treatments such as physical therapy, pain management techniques, or dental repairs.\n\nIn the meantime, you may try to avoid excessive jaw movement and clenching, and apply heat or ice to the affected area to alleviate any pain or discomfort.",

As per doctor instruction, operation of my nose was carried out before three months. Now my nose is almost fine, but still I feel that something is there in my throat. I also feel itchy throat and every 10 minutes I need to make a sound to get relief of this itching. After nose operation, my ENT surgeon suggested Levocet M for my throat problem. He advised me to take daily one tablet at night for six months and slowly throat problem will be cured. I am taking Levocet M for the last three months, but still my throat problem remains the same. Please suggest me whether should I continue or stop this tablet. Is there any side effect if I am taking this medicine for a long time? Please suggest me what should I do. Will you recommend me to take any other medicine?",

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nIt is important to discuss this with your ENT surgeon as they are familiar with your medical history and can offer the best advice for your individual case.\n\nThat being said, Levocet M contains Levocetirizine, which is an antihistamine used to treat allergies. It may help with your itchy throat symptom, but if it has not improved after taking it for three months, it may not be the right medication for you.\n\nLong term use of Levocetirizine can cause side effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth, and headaches. It is important to discuss with your doctor whether it is safe for you to continue taking it for an extended period of time.\n\nYour throat symptoms may be caused by other factors such as acid reflux or postnasal drip, which may require additional treatment. Your ENT surgeon may recommend additional testing or medications to address these issues.\n\nIn summary, I recommend discussing this with your ENT surgeon to determine the best course of action for your specific case.",

We used a condom the whole time, but I was worried there could have been a leak and got her an I-pill within 18 hours of intercourse. She has had no bleeding whatsoever since then and not even had her periods yet. Is there anything to worry? She normally gets her periods in 28 days. Please help.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. How are you doing? The act of sex was on day-15 of the period, that is, very close to the ovulation date. But as you said that a condom had been used all the time and you only have a doubt of spill, the chances of a pregnancy is very very low. As the pill was taken within 24 hours of sex, its success is also very high.  This pill is a progesterone hormone in a high dose. So, the period would be slightly delayed. Some do get their periods within 10 days of the pill, but I would suggest you wait until seven to 10 days of the expected date. So, wait until the 25th of this month. She should get her periods by then. If still no periods, it is due to the deranged hormonal levels due to the pill. If still doubtful about condom failure, have a home urine pregnancy test. Once confirmed as negative, have tablet Duoluton-L (Ethinylestradiol and Levonorgestrel) or Intimacy plus 3 (Ethinylestradiol and Desogestrel) or Novelon or Ovral-G - one tablet twice a day for 10 days (throw away the 21st pill). No matter what the cause is (except pregnancy) she will have her periods within seven to 10 days. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries. All the best. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online  Take care.",
        "answer_chatgpt": "As you have mentioned that you used a condom during intercourse and also took an emergency contraceptive pill within 18 hours of the incident, which is an effective method to prevent pregnancy. The emergency contraceptive pill has a high success rate, but it may alter the menstrual cycle, and some women may experience delayed periods, or it may come early or late. So, it is normal to have a delay in periods after taking an emergency contraceptive pill.\n\nMoreover, stress, changes in lifestyle habits, and other factors can also cause menstrual irregularities. Hence, advise your friend to wait for a few more days and take a pregnancy test if her periods do not start even after one to two weeks of the expected date. If the pregnancy test is negative, then she should not worry, and her periods will start soon. But if the test is positive, then she should consult a gynecologist for further evaluation and management. \n\nHope this helps.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) The normal range for the duration of menstrual cycle is between 21 to 35 days. So if your period didn't come by now it should be considered as abnormal.2) The fact that she had intercourse with a condom on would suggest that she is protected from pregnancy. However, as you have taken an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hrs of unprotected sexual contact, it would provide protection against pregnancy also.3) It is possible that the I-pill may delay her next period or may cause irregularity in the future cycles.4) In my opinion, she needs to get examined by a gynecologist and get her complete hormonal profile done to rule out any hormonal imbalance."

        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. Blood in stool is not a normal condition as you are having the problem for one year. It should be investigated in detail and the following work-up will be useful. Rectal, anal area examination, stool routine microscopic examination, proctoscopy examination, colonoscopy, if needed. If needed during colonoscopy, biopsy taken from the abnormal area if found for histopathology examination. This work-up will be helpful to rule out causes for blood in stool like a polyp, proctitis, piles, colitis, diverticulitis, any growth, if present, etc. If the color of blood in stool is of brown-red color than bleeding is from the upper gastrointestinal tract. If colour is bright red then the cause for bleeding is from the lower gastrointestinal tract. So, from your provided history, this work-up should be done and above causes should be ruled out. One diagnosis cannot be given. Consult general surgeon or gastroenterologist for examination and above work up and according to cause identified further treatment plan can be decided. ",

Hemorrhoids - These are swollen and inflamed veins in the anus and lower rectum that may bleed during bowel movements.\n\n2. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) - Conditions such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can cause inflammation in the bowel, which may lead to bloody diarrhea.\n\n3. Diverticulitis - This is a condition in which small pouches form in the colon and become infected or inflamed, causing abdominal pain and bloody stool.\n\n4. Anal fissures - These are small tears in the lining of the anus that can cause pain and bleeding during bowel movements.\n\n5. Colorectal cancer - This is a serious condition in which cancer cells grow in the colon or rectum, and may cause blood in stool as well as other symptoms such as abdominal pain and weight loss.\n\nIt's important to have a healthcare provider evaluate your symptoms to determine the cause of your blood in stool.

        "input": "Hello doctor,Four months ago, I consulted you on this platform for premature complexes which I was having without any other symptoms. Below is my query and your answer - I am a male of 48 years of age. I have a lean build and do regular exercise. Since childhood, I had a tendency for heart palpitations and premature beats. After a few tests, anxiety was found to be the main cause.  You had said that most probably these premature complexes are originating from ventricles which are leading to the symptoms. These are usually benign and not life threatening. The only concern remains is that of coronary artery disease, which is also less likely as these are occurring from a long time and you are not having any other symptoms. Lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, smoking, caffeinated beverages are known triggering factors for these due to sympathetic overactivity. You should also get thyroid test done. I think, just be on a safer side, you should get one treadmill test done to rule out coronary artery disease and echo should be repeated. Afterwards, I met a cardiologist and got an ECG and echo tests done. The tests were normal. The cardiologist said that there is no need for TMT test since I do running and other exercises daily and there is no known risk factor for CAD. But the VPCs continued for a month.Then, I realized that I was taking a weight gainer supplement from the last one year which contained creatinine. Two months back, I was not doing any exercise due to a small fracture in my elbow but continued to take this supplement. The doctor advised me to stop the supplement immediately since this could be the cause of missed beats. Then I read in the internet and found out that there have been cases of irregular heart beats due to creatinine supplementation. I stopped taking the supplement although it was from a reputed firm and did not contain any steroids. The missed beats reduced after stopping the supplement and from the last two months, it has come to a normal level of one or two in a day. But somehow my mind started getting preoccupied with the thoughts of heart disease and I started reading about it from the internet and even textbooks.I have been thin and slim since my childhood, have been quite active physically, no family history of heart disease, no diabetes, no hypertension, non-smoker, rarely eat fried foods. My lipid profile is normal with HDL being about 55 whenever tested, CRP is around 0.5. But in spite of this, I was not able to free my mind from worries of CAD. A month back, I did quite a lot of pushups after a gap of four to five months. After three to four days, I started having pain in my chest here and there mostly at rest. After a week I got an ECG done which was normal. The pain subsided slowly but whenever I did some exercise which put a strain on the chest muscle I started having pain and with pain, more worries.Then I met a psychiatrist. He said that I have got into an obsessive loop, which is part of health anxiety disorder which is causing these psychosomatic symptoms of chest pain. He advised me to take some antidepressants for three months, do Yoga and meditation and take some sessions of cognitive behavior therapy. I am reluctant to take antidepressants but have already started doing some meditation and Yoga. He also prescribed Alprazolam .25 mg on SOS basis. Now the pain is subsiding slowly and obsessive thoughts are also reducing. I have stopped doing any exercise that would put a strain on the chest. I do not know how long it will take to resume it. In a recent blood test, two months back my vitamin D3 was at 28. Could it be the cause of the chest pain? Secondly, I stopped the supplement but continued some strenuous exercises without taking a proper diet. Could it be the cause of it? Please guide me. How to get rid of this unwanted health anxiety which I have got into?",

It is important to continue to work with both your primary care physician and mental health provider to address both the physical and psychological aspects of your symptoms.  \n\nIn regards to your questions about possible causes of your chest pain, vitamin D deficiency can be associated with muscle weakness and pain, but it is unlikely to be the sole cause of your symptoms. Additionally, inadequate nutrition can also contribute to muscle weakness and pain. It would be best to discuss these concerns with your primary care provider to rule out any underlying medical issues.\n\nRegarding your supplements and exercise, it is important to maintain a well-balanced diet and to avoid strenuous exercise that causes chest pain until you have been cleared by your primary care provider or cardiologist to do so. It may also be helpful to work with a certified personal trainer or exercise physiologist to develop a safe and appropriate exercise regimen.\n\nLastly, it is important to continue to work with your mental health provider to address your health anxiety.

I was admitted after having three blocked arteries, at 99, 93 and 88 percent, and successfully had three stents put in.

Also, I have congestive heart failure with a fraction rate of 42.

We cannot make predictions on your heart function, but we can hope that everything will be fine. Unfortunately, this is a chronic and serious medical condition, which cannot be cured. The optimization of the therapy and a healthy lifestyle can help improve your survival and improve your life quality. For more information consult a cardiologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! I'm an AI language model and a medical professional, but I cannot provide individual medical advice. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nIn general, a vegan diet is a healthy choice for most people, as long as it is balanced and provides all the necessary nutrients. Fish and chicken can be part of a healthy diet as well, but red meat and processed meats should be limited because they are high in saturated fats and can increase the risk of heart disease.\n\nRegarding the \"cheat\" meal, it is important to maintain a healthy diet most of the time. If you indulge occasionally, it shouldn't do much damage. However, it is best to choose healthier options for that meal than red meat, which is high in saturated fat and can worsen your heart disease. You can consider grilled chicken or fish, or a plant-based option.\n\nRegarding your congestive heart failure, it's great that you are working on a healthy lifestyle with diet and exercise. Carvedilol is an important medication for heart failure, and it's important to take it as prescribed. It might take some time to see the improvement in your ejection fraction, but it's possible with proper treatment and lifestyle changes. Be sure to follow up with your doctor regularly to monitor your heart function and adjust your treatment as needed.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) A single cheat meal should not cause any significant harm. 2) It is good that you are taking steps to reduce your heart failure symptoms by changing your lifestyle.3) Usually, people with heart failure have a lowered ejection fraction (EF). Your EF is only 42%, which means that your heart muscle is weakening and failing to pump blood efficiently. You will need more medications to help improve your heart function.4) Exercise is also important for improving the cardiac output and thus reducing the workload of the heart.5) In summary, the best way to manage heart failure is through a combination of dietary changes, regular exercise, and medication. Hope this helps."

        "input": "Hello doctor,I and my fiancee had intercourse a month back with a condom and also she had an emergency contraceptive pill. I bought it from a medical. They asked her to take it before one hour of intercourse. She had a regular period. Her last period was on 7th of last month but it is 11th of next month now and till now she did not get her periods. She does not want to get pregnant now as she has her exams in a few months. She is doing heavy exercise like cycling, spot jogging, sit ups. And also she has taken two raw papayas, four pineapples and three times ginger syrup. I am sure that condom did not get broken. My doubts are will she get pregnant? Is there really a pill available to be taken before intercourse. Is that pill true? What she can do further to get her periods? Can she take Probers tablet for getting it?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Stress plays important role in periods. She might be freaking out with the fear of getting pregnant, with exams on the head causing a delay in her periods. Please consider doing a pregnancy test, most likely, it will be negative, and that will help her relax. Periods will gradually occur. No need to worry. Yes, there are medicines for getting periods, but they might worsen her condition by causing mood swings, as she already has taken an emergency contraceptive. Secondly, emergency contraceptives should be taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, the earlier, the better effect. She has taken it quite early even before intercourse, so chances of pregnancy are nil. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "There is always a chance of pregnancy with any form of contraception, including condoms and emergency contraceptives. However, the likelihood of pregnancy is reduced when both methods are used together.\n\nThe emergency contraceptive pill is a real medication that can be effective if taken within 72 hours (or up to 120 hours for some brands) of unprotected intercourse. It works by delaying or preventing ovulation, or preventing fertilization of the egg. It is not a pill that can be taken before intercourse.\n\nHeavy exercise and certain foods can potentially affect menstrual cycles, but it is not guaranteed. It is important for your fiancee to speak with a healthcare provider about any concerns regarding her menstrual cycle, as they can conduct tests and provide guidance on the best course of action.\n\nIt is not recommended to take Probers (Progesterone) tablets to induce menstruation without consulting a healthcare provider first. They can provide a safe and effective method to induce menstruation if necessary.\n\nIt is important to discuss all contraception options and use them properly and consistently to reduce the risk of pregnancy. Condoms are effective at preventing sexually transmitted infections, but may not always prevent pregnancy. Emergency contraceptive pills are a backup option, but should not be relied upon as primary contraception.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) Pregnancy is unlikely to occur if you have used the condom correctly, unless there was some breakage or slippage during sex.2) Emergency contraception (EC) is not a pill. It is a combination of hormones which is given as a single dose after unprotected sex. EC is most effective within 72 hours of unprotected sex.3) There is no such thing as \"pregnancy prevention\" pill.4) Your girlfriend needs to wait and observe for her menstrual cycle to come back. If it does not come by end of this month, she should get a urine pregnancy test done.5) You can help your girlfriend by giving her plenty of fluids and nutritious foods."

You can go for HIV antibodies tests after 3 months exposure to have final conclusive results to relieve your anxiety. For more information consult a community medicine physician online ",

The torn frenulum doesn't increase the chances of HIV transmission on its own. \n\nThe PCR RNA test is a reliable method of detecting HIV infection early on. However, it may not be accurate during the window period (the time when the body is producing antibodies to HIV but the virus is not yet detectable by a test), which is about 2-4 weeks after exposure. A follow-up test is recommended after 4-6 weeks to confirm the results. \n\nIn addition to HIV, it's also recommended to get tested for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. It's important to use protection during each sexual encounter to prevent STIs and unwanted pregnancies. \n\nLastly, it's important to take care of your mental health during this time of anxiety and stress.

It is unlikely for antibiotics and other medications which you had taken for fever could affect the result. Window period is the time taken for antibodies to develop after infection and then get detected by a particular test. The length of the window period varies between individuals. There are recommendations and I also suggest my patients to repeat the test at six months of last exposure. Testing at three and six months of possible exposure can detect almost all HIV infections. You can take precautions (consistently and correctively using a condom) with your wife until the time you are undergoing tests. I hope this helps.  Take care.",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Based on the information provided, it appears that your risk of HIV transmission was low because you used protection during sexual activity. However, it is possible that the vaginal fluid could have touched the skin around the condom, which may increase the risk of transmission compared to a completely protected encounter.\n\nRegarding your HIV testing, the DNA PCR test at 66 days after the exposure is indeed useful since it is able to detect HIV earlier than antibody tests. The HIV RNA/DNA PCR test is generally considered conclusive after 21 days, but when used in combination with subsequent antibody tests, it can provide additional reassurance.\n\nThe tridot test is an antibody test that detects the presence of antibodies to HIV, which the body develops in response to the infection. The test is reliable after the window period, which is the interval between the time of infection and the time when the antibodies are detectable. The window period for most antibody tests is about 4 weeks to 3 months, depending on the specific test used.\n\nIt is important to note that, during the window period, HIV tests may not detect the virus, which means a negative test result does not necessarily rule out infection. However, since you have tested negative at multiple time points outside the window period, it is unlikely that you have HIV.\n\nThe use of fever tablets, antibiotics, or Levocetirizine during the window period should not affect the accuracy of the HIV tests.\n\nRegarding your question about having sex with your wife, it's important to note that while your test results suggest that you are not infected with HIV, there is still a potential risk of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It is recommended that you use protection during sexual activity with your wife and consider getting tested for other STIs as well. It is always a good idea to discuss sexual health with your partner and use protection to prevent STIs and unwanted pregnancies. A follow-up test may be recommended by your healthcare provider depending on your individual risk factors.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. I understand your concern. The tests that you have done are appropriate for your situation. DNA PCR test is done when there is a possibility of exposure by genital secretions. It can detect HIV for up to 66 days after exposure. Tridot test is done to detect HIV antigen in blood. It may be positive even if viral load is very low. You should do this test only once as it has high false positive results. The immunofiltration test is done to detect antibody against HIV. It requires fresh serum sample. If it is negative then you need not worry about HIV. You can have unprotected sex with your wife provided she is not infected. However, if she is infected then she needs to take precautions and get tested."

She is less confident too.I suspect that she may have depression rather than schizophrenia and I noticed that she has significant anxiety, victim mentality (quite important) and some sleeping problems.She is insecure and she dropped out of several educations in the last couple of years.She has abusive parents and she went back living with them.She has recently received cognitive therapy but she felt insulted and not helped.She and I wish to find a solution for her.Thank you.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I can understand your concern. I have read the query and after reading the history of hers I can tell you that these symptoms suggest more towards some neurotic illness specifically depression rather than catatonic schizophrenia. In catatonic schizophrenia patients show symptoms like negativism, echolalia (automatic repetition of words spoken by other persons), echopraxia (involuntary or automatic repetition of the movements of other persons), waxy flexibility etc. She has developed illness in episodes and not continuously, which also points more towards depression because psychotic illnesses run a continuous course. Her symptoms like lack of confidence, anxiety, poor sleep, feelings of insecurity, feeling of unhappiness, less talkative etc., suggest depression. There is no history of any suspiciousness, no history suggestive of hallucinations which weakens diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. So, in my opinion from available history her diagnosis is more likely to be depression rather than catatonic schizophrenia. Even in severe depression individuals may present with depressive stupor which can mimic a catatonia. Please visit her doctor again and ask for reevaluation of diagnosis. She responded to amisulpride ( ChatDoctor.  Aripiprazole can help in psychosis but in depression its use is limited. In my opinion there is need to add some good antidepressant. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "It is important to keep in mind that a definitive diagnosis can only be made after a comprehensive evaluation by a qualified mental health professional. However, based on the information provided, it is possible that your friend could be experiencing a combination of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to experiences with her abusive parents. While a diagnosis of schizophrenia cannot be ruled out based on your description of her symptoms, other conditions such as depression and PTSD can also present with similar symptoms such as anxiety, sleeping problems, and feelings of unhappiness.\n\nThe side effects that your friend is experiencing are also common with antipsychotic medications, such as Solian and Abilify. Hyperprolactinemia (high prolactin levels) is a common side effect of certain antipsychotics, which can lead to weight gain and other physical symptoms. Although switching to Abilify may have helped to address the high prolactin levels, the medication can still have side effects such as increased hunger and weight gain.\n\nConsidering your friend's negative experience with cognitive therapy, it may be worth seeking out alternative forms of therapy such as interpersonal therapy, psychotherapy or mindfulness-based therapy. These therapies may be better suited to address her specific needs and personal preferences. In addition, it may be helpful to encourage her to engage in physical activity or exercise, which has been shown to be effective for mood and anxiety disorders.\n\nOverall, it is important that your friend continues to work closely with her mental health professionals to manage her symptoms and side effects to find the most effective treatment plan for her.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor. I would like to know if your friend has ever seen a psychiatrist or mental health professional? In your description of symptoms, there are a few things that suggest that she might have been misdiagnosed. The fact that she was willing to go into hospital suggests that she is not having hallucinations nor delusions. She does sound like she is suffering from depression and anxiety which can occur with schizophrenia but she does not seem to fit the criteria for schizophrenia. Also, the fact that she was able to recognize that abilify was working indicates that she is aware enough to understand what is going on in her mind. Schizophrenic patients usually do not have insight into their illness. Schizophrenia is very difficult to treat without proper diagnosis and treatment. I hope this helps."

After the age of 40, the risk of fertility issues, miscarriage, and complications during pregnancy increases. Women over the age of 40 also have a higher likelihood of developing gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa or abruption, and other medical conditions. \n\nIt is important to schedule a consultation with your obstetrician and discuss your individual health and medical history to determine the best course of action for a successful pregnancy.",

The risk of uterine rupture is about 2% or less. It is important that you find a doctor experienced in VBAC delivery.

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned, it is not clear if you are already taking any medications for hypothyroidism or not. Hope you find my advice of some benefit. Good luck. Revert after three months to an endocrinologist online  Take care.",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! Your TSH level indicates that you have hypothyroidism. However, it is important to confirm the diagnosis by doing other thyroid function tests, such as free T3 and free T4 levels. Additionally, a physical examination and possibly an ultrasound of the thyroid may be needed.\n\nRegarding medication, levothyroxine is usually the first-line treatment for hypothyroidism. The dosage will depend on your age, weight, and other medical conditions, and your doctor will prescribe the appropriate dose. It may take a few weeks to notice any improvement in your symptoms.\n\nYour symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, and throat pain could be due to hypothyroidism, but they could also have other causes. It's important to discuss your symptoms with your doctor and get a proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, it is recommended to avoid foods that can interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine, such as soy products, walnuts, and high-fiber foods, and take the medication on an empty stomach, in the morning, at least 30 minutes before having breakfast.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1. The symptoms you describe may indicate hypothyroidism but they are not specific for it. It can be caused by many other conditions as well. So, before starting any treatment, you should first get an endocrinologist consultation and do some blood tests like free T3 and free T4, total T3, total T4, anti-TPO antibodies etc.2. Thyroid hormone levels may increase due to stress or anxiety. So, if your TSH was normal before then there is no need to start medications unless the above mentioned blood tests show abnormal values.3. If all the tests come back normal, then you should try to relax and take care of yourself. Try to avoid stressful situations and eat healthy food."

The sheet says moderate pulmonary hypertension with peak pressure 54 mmHg and central venous pressure of 15.0. Since I only picked up the results no one explained it to me but set up an appointment with lung and heart specialist in six months. What does all this mean? I am a hypertensive and pre-diabetic. Currently, I am on Lisinopril 10 mg.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. This means pressure in the pulmonary circulation has increased likely due to lung problem (if echo is not showing any abnormalities other than this). Likely this is related to obesity although we need to rule out other causes of pulmonary hypertension by doing CT scan and other few investigations. Do you have shortness of breath, any other symptoms to suggest some cause? You should focus on healthy lifestyle and weight loss.  For more information consult a cardiologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nPulmonary hypertension is a condition where the blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs becomes elevated, which can lead to strain on the right side of the heart. The peak pressure measurement of 54 mmHg indicates that the pressure in these arteries is moderately elevated, and the central venous pressure of 15.0 indicates that there may be some congestion in the blood vessels leading to the heart.\n\nThere are many possible causes of pulmonary hypertension, including underlying lung or heart disease, blood clots in the lungs, or connective tissue disorders, among others. It is important to follow up with a specialist, such as a pulmonologist or cardiologist, to determine the underlying cause and to begin appropriate treatment.\n\nYour current medications, including lisinopril, may also need to be adjusted or modified to treat pulmonary hypertension. It is important to continue to monitor your blood pressure and blood sugar levels as well, as poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes can contribute to the development and progression of pulmonary hypertension.\n\nOverall, pulmonary hypertension can be a serious condition that requires proper diagnosis and treatment. I would encourage you to keep your follow-up appointment and to discuss any concerns or questions with your healthcare provider.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi there, Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in your lungs. It can be due to many reasons like heart disease, lung diseases etc. You have to get ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography and spirometry done for evaluation.

I want to complement this treatment with a healthy skin care regime. I read that aloe vera gel and certain essential oils such as carrot seed and lavender essential oil aid in skin regeneration. My question is can I apply these oils (diluted in grapeseed oil) or aloe vera gel as an overnight lotion? Will it clash with whatever process the viva treatment has initiated within my skin? I do not like the night cream offered by my cosmetologist as it appears a little too emollient and does not smell that good. Also, I would rather use something natural.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. I have noted your concern. A resurfacing treatment would leave your skin red and sensitive for a few days till the epidermis regenerates fully. So, you should be judicious in using products which supposedly while aiding skin regeneration are in fact, irritating or comedogenic. I am against using essential oils on the face, particularly because they usually do not suit sensitive skin and being an oil they can flare up acne which I am sure would be the last thing in the world you would be expecting, considering that you are taking these sessions to improve the appearance of your acne scars. Aloe vera gel is a good option and you can definitely use it post resurfacing sessions. Make sure you use a good brand and not raw aloe vera extracted directly from the leaves. For more information consult a dermatologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Thank you for your question! It's great to hear that you're taking steps to complement your Venus Viva skin resurfacing treatment with a healthy skincare regime. \n\nIn terms of using aloe vera gel and essential oils such as carrot seed and lavender essential oil, it's generally safe to use these as an overnight lotion. However, it's important to keep in mind that everyone's skin is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. \n\nFurthermore, it's essential to make sure that you're diluting the essential oils in a carrier oil such as grapeseed oil, as pure essential oils can be too strong for the skin and may cause irritation. Aloe vera gel can also be mixed with a carrier oil and applied to the skin as a moisturizer. \n\nWhen it comes to using these natural ingredients alongside your Venus Viva treatment, it's always best to consult with your cosmetologist or dermatologist to ensure that the products you're using won't disrupt the treatment process or cause any adverse effects. \n\nLastly, when choosing a night cream or moisturizer, it's important to pick something that works well for your skin type and provides the appropriate level of hydration. If you're not a fan of the cream offered by your cosmetologist, it's okay to explore other options, but it's recommended that you look for products that are specifically formulated for use on sensitive skin, as the skin may be more vulnerable following treatment. \n\nI hope this helps, and best of luck with your Venus Viva treatment and skincare regime!",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1. Aloe vera gel is used for topical application after sunburn. It is not a suitable ingredient for facial skin.2. Essential oils should never be applied directly on the skin without dilution.3. Carrot seed oil is rich in vitamin A which is beneficial for skin but it may cause irritation if applied directly on face.4. You can apply night creams containing hyaluronic acid and ceramides.5. Lavender essential oil has antioxidant properties and may be beneficial for your skin.6. You can also apply vitamin C serum for better results."

If you are still experiencing pain after a few days, then it would be best to consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis.

After diagnosis, the doctor can recommend appropriate treatment, which may include medication, physical therapy, or even surgery in severe cases. \n\nFor the meantime, it would be best to take measures to prevent and manage the pain, such as avoiding heavy lifting and engaging in stretching and strengthening exercises for your back muscles.

Additionally, some doctors may recommend avoiding cold foods simply as a precautionary measure, in case they do cause discomfort or aggravate the condition.\n\nUltimately, whether or not you can eat cold foods when you have tonsillitis will depend on your individual level of comfort and sensitivity. If eating cold foods makes your throat feel more painful or swollen, it's best to avoid them until your symptoms have improved.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As you said, it is an old belief that one should not eat cold things while having tonsillitis. But nowadays with researches done, people have come to know that it has no relation with tonsils. It is just a myth which our parents used to believe. Now days, we have antibiotics available which cure the disease within few days. So there is no need for such myths. For your information, I would like to tell you that tonsils are lymphoid tissue present at back of throat. They help to fight against the entry of viruses and bacteria into our body. So to maintain their efficiency they require proper care and nourishment. But when they get inflamed due to any cause, they become useless and painful. The best way to treat them is to take antibiotic course for 5-7 days and then start eating soft warm foods"

I was never pushed to go by my parents when I was younger, only when I needed a new pair of glasses.I was born with one eye small, the other normal. My vision is fine, I am very nearsighted but with glasses, I see quite well. My depth perception is normal too, I can see most things and when I tried to drive once, it went well. In my affected eye pupil is floating around. I cannot see much out of it, and it is not big enough.Other than that, no other health conditions. Could anyone tell me what this is?

Other eyes appear normal but I will advise you to get a fundus in the left eye also to rule out any retinal anomaly. The condition in the right will always remain like this and this condition will not affect the left eye. If it is normal just do not engage in activities that can lead do an injury in the left eye also. So please consult a vitreoretinal specialist to rule out any retinal lesions in the left eye and get yourself rechecked for glasses every six months. Though your left eye appears very normal from outside but since you are nearsighted I will advise you to get retinal examination in your normal eye too, so that if there is any treatable lesion we can fix it at an early stage. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Based on your description, it sounds like you may have a condition called microphthalmia, which is a congenital condition where one eye is smaller than the other. The floating pupil in your affected eye could be due to a condition called posterior polar cataract, which can cause the lens to become opaque and interfere with vision. There may also be other conditions affecting your vision that could be related to your microphthalmia. However, it is not possible to give a specific diagnosis or prognosis without a thorough eye examination.\n\nIt is important that you see an eye doctor regularly to monitor any changes in your vision or eye health. With proper care and management, you may be able to maintain good vision throughout your life.",

As you have been diagnosed as having a small pupil in your right eye, it would be advisable for you to consult an Ophthalmologist, and get further investigations done, such as CT Scan or MRI scan of the brain to rule out any possible cause.

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. This rise in creatinine levels is usually related to a kidney dysfunction. For this reason, I suggest performing further tests to investigate your kidney function like creatinine clearance, a urine analysis, urine microalbuminuria and consult with a nephrologist. It is also necessary performing a urinary tract ultrasound. Chronic hyperuricemia can lead to chronic damage to the kidneys. Anyway, I reviewed all your performed tests and would explain they are normal (normal blood lipid profile, complete blood count, thyroid function, fasting glucose, uric acid levels).

        "answer_chatgpt": "A serum creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL indicates that there may be some impairment in your kidney function. You should try to identify the underlying cause of the elevated creatinine level. Since you are already taking medicines for different conditions, it is important to rule out the possibility of medication-induced kidney damage.\n\nIt is also important to follow a low protein diet and avoid foods that are high in potassium and sodium. Drink plenty of fluids to keep yourself hydrated. It is advisable to consult a nephrologist who will be able to evaluate you further and suggest appropriate treatment if required.\n\nYou should also monitor your blood sugar and blood pressure regularly as these can also contribute to kidney function impairment. Regular exercise and weight management can also help in improving kidney function.\n\nHope this helps!",

        "input": "Hello doctor,Four months ago, I had an encounter with a CSW. During that time, I kissed her mouth, boobs, and the outer lips of the vagina (not vagina). I had taken tests for HIV, HBsAg, HSV, after three months and all those came negative. During that time, I had taken a normal urine test for UTI. In that report, the pus cell values are 3 to 6.My questions are:I had not taken any separate test for gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas. May I take that normal urine test report (whose pus cell values were 3 to 6) as conclusive because in a forum, I have read that pus cell values of more than 10 is only considered as STD. Or, do I have to take a separate test for those?Is there any chance of oral HPV transmission by kissing the lips (mouth), and the outer covering of vagina. If so, is any blood test available for testing oral HPV?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. You said you did your HIV test three months after sexual exposure. So, it is very unlikely that you got infected. Secondly, the likelihood of getting gonorrhea and other infections which you mentioned are very unlikely after three months. If you had developed gonorrhea, there would be discharge or bumps over the penis within one month. About oral HPV, if your sexual partner had this infection, then there is a possibility of transmission, but that too is very unlikely. If you had developed, you would have symptoms by now. There would be at least minute warts that would have appeared over the oral cavity or genitalia. So, do not get tensed. Be cool. Take care not to have encounters with unknown persons and if you do, I suggest using adequate protection in the form of condoms. For more information consult a venereologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "As an AI language model, I cannot diagnose or provide specific medical advice. It's recommended that you consult a healthcare professional for your concerns.\n\nRegarding your first question, a urine test for a UTI cannot diagnose gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas. These infections require either swab or blood tests, depending on the specific STI. If you have concerns about these infections, it would be best to discuss with a healthcare professional and get the appropriate testing.\n\nRegarding your second question, oral HPV transmission is possible through kissing but it is not very common. HPV is usually diagnosed by a clinical examination and biopsy in some cases. Currently, there are no blood tests available to diagnose oral HPV. It would be best to discuss your concerns with a healthcare professional who can provide more specific information and testing if needed.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. The pus cells count of 3 to 6 is within normal limits. Pus cells counts greater than 10 suggest the presence of some organisms like Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa etc. So, your result may not be significant if you have not taken any other test. Yes, you can take the test for Chlamydia and Trichomonas, which will help you to diagnose the infection. Your results will come back in few days. You don't need to worry about it. The oral HPV virus is transmitted through kissing, but it does not lead to any serious health problems. It usually goes away without treatment. Hope this helps. Take care"

As per your reports, it has come up to 1.01. This means that your body requires more of Thyroxine hormone which is produced by the thyroid gland. Since the TSH levels have increased, we need to check if you are having any other symptoms like weight gain or tiredness or hair fall etc. If none of these symptoms are present then you can continue with the same dose of 100mcg of Eltroxin."

Handjobs, without any exchange of bodily fluids, are considered a low-risk activity for HIV transmission.\n\nFurthermore, if the masseuse had any cuts on her hand, the virus would not survive outside of the body for more than a few minutes.\n\nIt is important to note that while the risk for HIV transmission may be low, there are still other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can be transmitted through genital touching. It is recommended that you get tested for any STIs if you are sexually active.\n\nIt's great that you have consulted with your local GP, who has reassured you that there is no risk of HIV transmission in this situation.

In the meantime, try to avoid hard, crunchy foods and focus on eating a balanced diet that is low in sugar and acid. Additionally, make sure you are practicing good oral hygiene by brushing twice a day and flossing daily.\n\nYour dentist may recommend options such as fillings, crowns, or even dental implants to replace any damaged or missing teeth. Regular check-ups and cleanings can also help prevent further damage to your teeth.\n\nDon't delay in seeking treatment, as the longer you wait, the more extensive the damage may become.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand your concern. At present, there is no way to prevent tooth decay in permanent teeth. The only alternative is to remove the tooth and replace it with an artificial substitute called dentures. Denture can be made from acrylic resin (plastic) or metal alloys such as gold, palladium, nickel, etc. They are designed to fit over the gums and provide a natural-looking smile. In some cases, however, dentures may need to be relined every few years to maintain a proper fit. Relining is a procedure done in the dentist office where new denture material is placed over the existing denture. It is not a complicated process and does not require any special preparation. You should consult your dentist for further information and treatment. Hope this helps. Take care."

Removing the bladder is a valuable exercise and is the last resort for superficial tumors. For deep tumors or recurrent tumors, there is no other option but the removal of bladder or radiotherapy.

If his bladder cancer is in the earliest stages and the surgeon could only remove 70% of it, it's possible that he may need to undergo additional scrapings to remove the remaining cancer cells. However, if he's experiencing a lot of discomfort and complications, he may want to discuss other treatment options with his doctor, such as immunotherapy or a bladder-sparing procedure.\n\nBladder removal, or cystectomy, is generally recommended for invasive bladder cancer or high-grade non-invasive cancer that has not responded to other treatments. It's an intensive surgery that involves removing the bladder and creating a new way for urine to exit the body, often using part of the intestines. This decision should be made in consultation with your father's urologist or oncologist based on the type, stage, and location of the cancer, as well as your father's overall health and lifestyle.\n\nIt's important to continue monitoring his cancer regularly and to follow any treatment or surveillance plans recommended by his doctors, as bladder cancer can recur even after successful treatment. Encourage your father to speak openly with his healthcare providers about any concerns or questions he may have about his treatment plan, as well as any side effects or complications he experiences.",

It is a safe procedure, but the possibility of recurrence and progression is very high. So, one should be prepared for the fact that there may be recurrences and progression. 2. Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in patients with superficial bladder tumors because the tumor makes them prone to UTI. 3. Kidney infection is less common.4.

Besides, a positive test does not always indicate an active infection. The fact that your tests resulted in positive means that you have gone through this infection in the past. In fact, herpes 1 is a very common infection (almost everyone has gone through it). So, I do not think that your symptoms are related to these types of infections. In many cases, no cause of peripheral neuropathy is found (idiopathic peripheral neuropathy). Regarding the pain and burning sensation, I would recommend starting treatment with Pregabalin or Gabapentin. Another possible treatment option would be Duloxetine.

SJS is a condition in which the skin and mucous membranes (lining the mouth, nose, and eyes) blister and peel off.\n\nWhile it is impossible to predict with certainty who might develop SJS while taking modafinil, there are several known risk factors. These include a prior history of SJS, a genetic predisposition (such as the HLA-B*1502 gene), and concomitant use of other medications (such as lamotrigine). It is important to note that the risk of SJS while taking modafinil is rare, estimated to be in the range of 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000 patients.\n\nTo avoid SJS, it is essential to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of the condition.

Change your baby's diaper as soon as it gets wet or soiled.\n\n3. Avoid using wipes with alcohol or fragrances as they can irritate your baby's skin.

I learned that symptoms can show as quickly as 1 to 3 days in cases of reinfestation and I immediately recognized the small red itchy dots that I began developing along with a burrow line due to having contracted scabies years ago after a holiday.I successfully treated myself and the symptoms eased. I visited my partner again only to have been reinfested by him. Although he showed no symptoms, he did the Permethrin treatment and I repeated treatment. Symptoms eased. This was eight weeks ago. Since staying at his room two days ago, symptoms have appeared again. Itching along with new red rash is appearing due to scratching. I have done the ink test and am convinced that the little line shown on my forearm is a burrow forming.What if I fail to understand that he has the disease and continues to experience no symptoms. It has been almost 11 weeks. How is this possible? Could scabies lay dormant for some time in darker, stronger skin? The anxiety this is giving me is crippling. Please advise.",

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nIt is possible for someone to be a carrier of scabies without showing symptoms. This means that they can still spread scabies to others even if they don't have any signs of the infection themselves. Scabies infestations can also take several weeks to fully develop, which may explain why your partner did not have symptoms immediately after you stayed with him.\n\nIt is important that you and your partner both receive treatment at the same time to ensure that the infection is fully eradicated. Even if your partner is not experiencing symptoms, he should still receive treatment to prevent the spread of scabies to others.\n\nScabies can survive for several days outside of the body, so it's possible that you could become reinfected if you come into contact with contaminated items, such as bedding or clothing.\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of scabies, it is important that you speak with a healthcare professional to receive treatment. Scabies can be treated with prescription medications, such as permethrin cream or ivermectin, which are usually very effective at killing the mites that cause the infection.\n\nI hope this helps!",

My gynecologist suggested Ceftum, Citralka, and Urispas for three days. After taking the course I was fine for two days. But, after two days, the UTI symptoms came back, but not as severe as the first time. I continued taking the same medicines again for three days. Still, there was discomfort, though the severity had reduced. I got a urine test done and attached the results. My gynecologist then put me on Nitrofurantoin, three tablets per day for a week and from the second week, I was asked to reduce the tablet to two per day. I have taken a total eight tablets, but there is still a burning sensation while passing urine, especially at night. Is this medicine effective? Will my UTI be cured by this medicine? For how many more days will there be a discomfort? Do I have to try a different medicine?

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello, I am sorry to hear that you have been suffering from UTI for the past 20 days despite undergoing treatment. Nitrofurantoin is an effective antibiotic for UTI, but sometimes the bacteria causing the infection may be resistant to it, and in that case, a different antibiotic may be needed.\n\nSince you still have discomfort while passing urine, it is important to check if the bacteria causing the UTI is sensitive to Nitrofurantoin. So, I suggest getting a culture and sensitivity test done on urine to identify the bacteria and its sensitivity to antibiotics.\n\nIf the culture report shows resistance to Nitrofurantoin, then your gynecologist may suggest changing the antibiotic to a different one, based on the sensitivity report. Also, if the infection is severe or not responding to oral antibiotics, your gynecologist may recommend the injection course of Amikacin 500.\n\nMeanwhile, you can follow some self-care measures which may help alleviate the discomfort, such as:\n\n- Drinking plenty of fluids to flush out the bacteria from the urinary tract.\n- Avoiding irritants like caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods which can worsen the symptoms.\n- Maintaining good hygiene practices like wiping from front to back after using the toilet to avoid bacteria entering the urethra.\n- Applying a warm compress over the lower abdomen for relief.\n- Emptying the bladder frequently and completely.\n\nI hope this helps.

        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. A mother who contracts chickenpox can do breastfeeding. Any vesicles present on the breast should be covered to minimize the risk of transmission. There is no evidence shown the presence of the varicella-zoster virus (Chickenpox) in breastmilk. Hence breastfeeding is safe. Breast milk does not transfer chickenpox to the baby. The doctor may prescribe Acyclovir 800 mg five times a day if you are seen within 24 hours of rash onset. It reduces the time to have full crusting of lesions and reduces the number of lesions. Acyclovir can be taken during breastfeeding. It is safe to take. Keep your nails short to minimize the damage from scratching.  Take care.",
        "answer_chatgpt": "As an AI language model, I cannot provide medical advice. However, according to medical experts, it is rare for breastfeeding mothers to transmit chickenpox to their babies through breast milk. The best way to prevent transmission is to keep infected areas of the body covered during close contact with the baby.\n\nIt is essential to take special care of your baby, and it may be a good idea to keep your baby away from anyone who has never had chickenpox or been vaccinated against it. You can continue breastfeeding unless a doctor advises otherwise. Breast milk contains antibodies that can help protect your baby from infections and illnesses.\n\nYou should consult a healthcare provider if you have any concerns or if you experience any complications related to chickenpox. They can give you personalized advice on how to take care of yourself and your baby.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) Breast milk does not transmit Chicken Pox. You can feed your baby without any fear that the infection will be transmitted through milk.2) It is unlikely that the baby will get Chicken Pox from you because the symptoms usually begin around two weeks after contact with an infected person.3) The only thing that needs to be done is to avoid physical contact with your baby while you have active rashes on your skin.4) If the rashes are extensive or severe, then you should consider taking anti-viral medications like Acyclovir to reduce the severity and duration of the illness.5) If you develop blisters on your nipples, you may want to discontinue breastfeeding until they heal completely.

HIV is not a robust virus and cannot survive outside the body for long periods of time. Additionally, the virus cannot be transmitted through intact skin.

Influenza vaccine is a very safe vaccine. Although some may have local pain, swelling, and fever. Some may have local lymphadenopathy. Lymphadenopathy is a swelling of lymph node (normal gland present in our body, which function as clearing harmful substances and providing immunity). Local and systemic reactions mostly began between day 1 and day 2. When a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process. It is a reactive response of the lymph node to the vaccination. So no need to worry. It can be managed by simple Paracetamol or anti-inflammatory medication such as Serratiopeptidase. It should resolve within a week. If it is associated with fever or any other site enlargement of lymph node you can visit your physician. I hope this helps. Reactive lymphadenitis.

I would recommend monitoring the lump over the next few days and see if it clears up on its own. If it does not improve, or if you experience any other concerning symptoms, such as fever or chills, it would be best to consult with a medical professional.\n\nIn general, any medical concerns or unusual symptoms that arise after receiving a vaccination should be discussed with your healthcare provider, who can evaluate your symptoms and advise you on the best course of action.",

I understand, that this virus is highly contagious but I am worried this may interfere with school. If I do get chicken pox, how long would it take for it to scab? Also, how long would it take for the scabbing to disappear, since I am very self-conscious? I look forward to a quick reply.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. It is highly probable that you will get infected unless your sister has been in isolation. There first few days of the rash are most infectious. When the scabs are formed infectivity is gone. It takes about two weeks or more for all the blisters to scab off so in case you are infected, I will say off school for two to three weeks. Hope this helps. But hoping you would not get infected. Avoid sharing a room or an enclosed space. For more information consult a general practitioner online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! I'm sorry to hear that your sister has chickenpox. You should definitely take measures to prevent getting the virus. Chickenpox is highly contagious and can easily be spread through contact with saliva, mucus, or blisters of an infected person. The virus can also be spread by airborne respiratory droplets from an infected person's coughing or sneezing.\n\nTo prevent getting chickenpox, you should:\n\n1. Avoid close contact with your sister, especially when she is coughing or sneezing. Stay at least 6 feet away from her at all times, and use a mask and gloves when necessary.\n2. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after coming into contact with your sister's belongings or surfaces she may have touched.\n3. Get vaccinated if you haven't already had chickenpox. This will greatly reduce your risk of becoming infected or developing a severe case of the disease.\n4. Boost your immune system by eating a healthy diet and getting adequate rest and exercise.\n\nThe chances of contracting chickenpox when living with an infected person are quite high without vaccination. If you do get infected with chickenpox, it typically takes about 10-21 days for the rash to scab over. It is important to note that you are contagious from one to two days before the rash appears until all the blisters have crusted over, which usually takes around five to ten days. The scabs generally take around one to three weeks to fall off completely.\n\nIt is understandable that you are feeling self-conscious about the scabs from the rash. You should take extra care during this time to avoid scratching the blisters, as this can lead to scarring. It is essential to keep the area clean and dry to ensure the blisters heal without infection.\n\nI hope this helps! Stay safe and healthy.",

Then they said I have a staphylococcus infection. It was moderate and I took the same antibiotics they prescribed. I did not have any symptoms but I treated it anyway.

So do not worry. If there are no symptoms, taking antibiotics every time may not be the right thing to do. Just maintain hygiene. Staphylococcus infection is also not an uncommon vaginal infection, sometimes even contamination from the surrounding areas while taking swab may show such a picture. Period delay due to this seems unlikely. Wait another week and recheck in the urine. If still negative, see a gynecologist who can examine you and find out the reason for it.

It's important to follow your doctor's instructions carefully and complete the full course of antibiotics.\n\nRegarding your missed period, it's possible that the infections you have had or the antibiotics you have taken for them could have disrupted your menstrual cycle. Antibiotics can sometimes affect the balance of hormones in the body, which may affect menstruation. Additionally, stress and changes in weight or diet can also affect menstrual cycles.\n\nIf you are concerned about the missed period or any other symptoms, it's important to follow up with your doctor. They may recommend further testing or evaluation to determine the cause of the missed period and any other symptoms you may be experiencing.\n\nIn the meantime, try to focus on taking care of yourself by getting plenty of rest, eating a balanced diet, and staying hydrated.

And also don't get panic about the infection leading to pregnancy. As far as the pregnancy is concerned, you can check it by doing urine pregnancy test. If you want, you can go ahead with it.

The amylase level shoots first and slowly decreases over two to three weeks. Lipase shoots slowly. No point in checking it very often as it usually takes time to normalize. Yours looks like a mild attack only and not a severe one. Once you are symptom-free you can relax. Get an amylase (amylase only, not lipase) after a month. Get an ultrasound scan also after a month. The disease needs avoidance of precipitating factors so that further damage to the pancreas can be prevented. Hope your queries have been cleared. For more infotrmation consutl a medical gastroenterologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nThank you for providing me with your reports. \n\nHigh levels of amylase and lipase may indicate pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas. Heavy alcohol consumption is a well-known cause of pancreatitis. \n\nThe good news is that you have stopped drinking, which is the most important step to prevent further damage to your pancreas. Additionally, the medications prescribed to you may have helped to reduce inflammation in your pancreas. \n\nHowever, it may take some time for your amylase and lipase levels to return to normal. This is because it takes time for the inflammation to fully heal. The amount of time it takes could vary from person to person and would depend on the severity of the inflammation. \n\nIn your case, I would recommend continuing to follow up with your doctor, who can monitor your progress and determine when your amylase and lipase levels have returned to normal. It's important to discuss any concerns or questions you may have with your doctor, as they can provide you with personalized advice and guidance. \n\nIn summary, it's great that you have stopped drinking and are taking steps to improve your health. With time and proper care, your amylase and lipase levels should return to normal, but it's important to continue to work with your doctor to monitor your progress. \n\nI hope this information helps!",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) Amylase and Lipase can be elevated in some conditions like pancreatic disease (pancreatitis), liver disease, gallbladder disease, alcohol intake, etc.2) The only way to know if your condition is due to these conditions is by doing an ultrasound of abdomen (upper GI endoscopy).3) You should do blood tests (complete blood count, serum electrolytes, liver function tests, kidney function tests, thyroid hormone levels, etc.)4) You should also stop alcohol consumption permanently.5) The best treatment is surgery for pancreas and gall bladder problems.6) If there is no evidence of any organic problem then you should continue with your medications and wait for amylase and lipase to come down."

This got more serious in the recent years. It used to occur three to four times every week, especially after lunch. I sought medical help and went to see a general physician, who ordered for blood tests. It revealed most of the levels to be normal, except for a mild elevation of ALT and AST levels. Then he ordered an ultrasound which showed I have a fatty liver, though I rarely drink alcohol. Also, H. pyroli came out as negative. He asked me to take a healthy diet and avoid alcohol. For indigestion, he prescribed Rabeprazole 20 mg every day, which seemed to help, since I did not get any indigestion anymore.More recently, I developed frequent loose motions. On some days, I pass stools thrice and have excessive gas. Over this period, I had four to five blood tests, which revealed that my hemoglobin was gradually decreasing. The first blood work done three years ago, showed my Hb to be 152 g/L, then 148, 143 and now in the last month it was 137 g/L. Also, my RBC count dropped from 4.89 to 4.5 million cells. My latest ferritin level was 194 ug/L. I asked my doctor here, and he ordered FOBT test. All three samples showed negative and no blood was found in the stool. Recently, he has ordered for a colonoscopy which I am waiting on, and I am really worried that I might have colon/rectal cancer. My question is, does negative FOBT and normal ferritin rule out any cancerous growth in the bowel and intestine? I have hypothyroidism and sleep apnea. I have no family history of bowel cancer.",

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nThank you for your detailed description. Based on the findings you have shared, it is good that you have undergone evaluations to identify any potential causes for your symptoms.\n\nRegarding your concern about colon/rectal cancer, the negative FOBT results and normal ferritin level indicate that there may not be any significant bleeding occurring in the bowel or intestine. It is essential to undergo a colonoscopy to evaluate further the presence of any growths or other abnormalities in the colon.\n\nFatty liver may cause indigestion, nausea and loss of appetite. The prescription you received for Rabeprazole helps in reducing the acidity in the stomach, which can also contribute to indigestion symptoms.\n\nRegarding your hypothyroidism and sleep apnea, these are conditions that require management by a specialist that could help in improving your overall health status.\n\nI recommend that you follow up with your physician about the colonoscopy results and continue with any prescribed medication or treatment. It is essential to maintain a healthy diet, regular exercise, and restful sleep to promote overall wellness.\n\nI hope this helps.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) FOBT (fecal occult blood testing) is usually positive in patients with colorectal cancer or polyps. But it may also be false positive due to many reasons like bleeding piles, constipation etc. So, it should always be followed by endoscopic examination. You need to do colonoscopy.2) Ferritin serum levels are very high in colon cancer.3) Hypothyroidism can also cause fecal occult blood positivity.4) Sleep apnea is associated with obesity. Obesity is one of the risk factors for colon cancer. So, if your BMI is high, you should reduce weight."

        "answer_chatgpt": "IntraLASIK and Contoura LASIK are both advanced technologies used in laser eye surgery to correct refractive errors such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. However, they are slightly different from each other.\n\nIntraLASIK, also known as Bladeless LASIK, is a femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK surgery. It involves creating a corneal flap using a femtosecond laser instead of a microkeratome blade, as in traditional LASIK. This technology is known for its precision and reduces the risk of complications during the procedure.\n\nContoura LASIK, on the other hand, is a type of custom LASIK procedure that uses topography-guided laser technology. It creates a detailed map of the cornea, including all of its subtle irregularities, and uses this information to make highly precise laser treatment patterns. This technology can provide better outcomes for patients with highly irregular corneas, such as those with keratoconus.\n\nIn summary, IntraLASIK is a variation of LASIK that uses a laser to create the corneal flap, while Contoura LASIK is a custom LASIK procedure that uses topography-guided laser technology.

IntraLASIK uses a femtosecond laser instead of a microkeratome to create a flap in the cornea. This laser is more precise than the microkeratome and can be programmed for individualized treatment plans.

I have had ECGs done on a few occasions and doctors said its unremarkable and commented that the main is orthopedic or neurological in nature. I have consulted a few reputed orthopedic and neurologic doctors and had subsequent MRIs, X-Rays, EMG and NCV done and all reports were normal. The pain was intermittent meanwhile. For the last three months the discomfort became worse. One doctor advised me to get a Cardiac CT done. The result of that showed a myocardial bridge.

Myocardial bridging - In your case, one of the heart artery LAD, the mid portion, passes through the cardiac muscles instead of lying on the wall. In the activity, when your heart rate increases due to this problem the blood flow reduce and causes discomfort to you. You try to avoid strenuous activities. With medicine, you will feel better but avoid strenuous activities. For more information consult a cardiologist online ",

Based on your symptoms, family history, and medical records, I highly recommend you to follow your doctor's prescription of beta-blockers and medications to control your high cholesterol levels. \n\nRegarding your myocardial bridge, it is a relatively common condition in which one or more of the coronary arteries tunnel under the heart muscle, creating a \"bridge-like\" structure. The bridge can cause a narrowing of the artery, leading to symptoms such as chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, and palpitations.\n\nAlthough the myocardial bridge is not necessarily a dangerous condition, it can be, in some cases, an associated risk factor for developing heart disease, especially if other factors, like smoking, obesity, or high blood pressure, are present.\n\nSince you have a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease, I would strongly advise you to adhere to a heart-healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress-management techniques, to keep your cardiovascular system in good shape. \n\nIt is also essential to have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to monitor your symptoms, medication side effects, and progress. Your doctor may recommend additional tests or procedures, like a stress test or angiogram, to evaluate your heart's function and assess your risk for developing heart disease.\n\nI hope this information helps to answer your questions.

However, if the wisdom tooth is impacted (meaning it is stuck beneath the gumline and not fully erupted), it can cause pain, infection, damage to surrounding teeth, and other complications. In these cases, it is often recommended to have the wisdom tooth removed. It is best to consult with a dental professional to determine the appropriate course of action for your specific situation.",

It is very easy to pop and it is addicting.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The sounds coming from the spine is called as snapping of joints. A synovial joint is a joint where two bony surfaces are enclosed in a capsule with synovial fluid enclosed in it. It is like sound coming from two wet surfaces placed together and now separated. It is a normal physical property. You feel good or relaxed on repeatedly doing it because of your habit. You do not have any muscle weakness. You should avoid doing it repeatedly as repeated forces over a limited area of the spine will predispose it to degenerative changes over the long term. To avoid getting feeling of back stiffness, start to a regular spinal exercise programme. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! The cracking or popping sound you hear when you squeeze your shoulder blades together is most likely related to the release of gas bubbles within the facet joints of the spine. The facet joints are small joints that connect the vertebrae and allow for movement of the spine. When you move the spine, the pressure within the joint changes and can cause gas bubbles to form or release. This is a normal process that happens to most people.\n\nHowever, if you are frequently popping your spine for relief of pain or discomfort, it could indicate that there is some underlying issue such as muscle stiffness or weakness, poor posture or alignment, or lack of flexibility. It is important to identify the root cause of your discomfort and address it appropriately.\n\nI recommend seeking evaluation with a healthcare provider to assess your spine and muscle health. They can recommend specific exercises or stretches to help alleviate your symptoms and prevent further damage to your spine. It is important to break the habit of frequently popping your spine to avoid worsening your condition.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " The sounds that you hear when you press your shoulder blade together may be due to the release of gas from within the joint capsule. This can occur with any injury to the joint. There is nothing wrong if you are doing this exercise as part of your routine. But if you feel discomfort in your neck or back, then stop doing this exercise immediately. You may also want to get yourself examined by a chiropractor who will help you find out what is causing the problem."

From a few months, my mother is suffering from chest pain. The doctor told it is chronic stable angina. All other tests are done like Na, K, hemoglobin, urea, and uric acid. The reports are quite fine. Our family doctor suggests me to take angiography. So, what should I do now? Please suggest.

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. With these kidney function tests, she can perform the coronary angiography. I agree with her doctor\\s recommendation because this would help identify possible coronary artery stenosis and also perform angioplasty, if necessary. Another test which can help investigate the presence of coronary ischemia is Dobutamine cardiac stress test. If this test results positive, the next step would be performing a coronary angiography. For more information consult a cardiologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! Based on your mother's medical history and symptoms, it seems that she has multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease - hypertension, diabetes, mild nephropathy, and hyperlipidemia. The presence of chest pain could be due to chronic stable angina, which is a type of heart disease caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.\n\nSince your family doctor has suggested angiography, it means that they suspect a possible blockage in the coronary arteries. Angiography is an invasive test that involves injecting a contrast dye into the arteries and taking X-rays to visualize the blood vessels. It can help determine the location and extent of any blockages.\n\nHowever, before proceeding with angiography, your mother's kidney function needs to be thoroughly assessed. With a creatinine level of 1.3, she is already at the lower limit of normal kidney function, and contrast dye can further impair it. Your mother may need to undergo a kidney function test (such as GFR) and possibly a nephrology consultation prior to angiography to ensure her renal function is stable.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to manage your mother's risk factors aggressively. Her blood pressure is still not optimally controlled, as the goal for patients with hypertension is <130/80 mmHg. Her fasting and postprandial blood sugar levels are also above the recommended targets (<100 mg/dL and <140 mg/dL, respectively). She may need to adjust her medication regimen, change her diet, and increase physical activity to better manage these conditions.\n\nAside from medical management, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, reducing alcohol intake, and regular exercise can also improve her cardiovascular health. Please discuss all these options with your family doctor and consider seeking a second opinion from a cardiologist to determine the best course of action.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1. Chronic angina is due to blockage in heart arteries leading to decreased blood supply to the heart muscle. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath (dyspnea), nausea, vomiting and sweating. It can also be associated with arm or jaw pain. 2. Your mother needs to undergo Angiogram to know whether she has significant blockages in her heart arteries. If there are no blockages then she may need only medications for control of her symptoms."

The sensation you are describing could be due to a number of different factors such as anxiety, heartburn, musculoskeletal pain or even cardiac issues. Given your medical history, there could be several underlying causes for your symptoms.\n\nIn order to determine the cause of your symptoms, I would recommend undergoing a thorough physical examination along with an ECG, as you have already mentioned. Further testing such as a blood test may also be required to assess your platelet count and check if there are any other underlying health issues.\n\nHaving a spleen enlargement and prostate enlargement can have significant implications on your overall health, therefore seeking medical attention as soon as possible is crucial in order to address these issues promptly.\n\nIn addition, it is important that you adopt stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises to help manage your anxiety.

I have been trying to lose weight for the past two months, but nothing has seemed to work. I go to the gym almost every day, and I do elliptical and treadmill. I also only eat about 1,350 calories a day. I do not know what to do because all my fat goes to my belly and it will not go away. Why am I not been losing weight when I go to the gym and only eat 1,300 calories a day? Please, I need advice as soon as possible.

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nIt sounds like you are experiencing a frustrating plateau in your weight loss journey despite your efforts. There are many reasons why this might be happening, so I will provide some possibilities based on the information you’ve provided.\n\n1. You may not be consuming enough calories: If your body is not getting enough calories to sustain regular bodily functions and your workouts, it might start to hold onto fat reserves. It is possible that you are not eating enough to fuel your body for the level of exercise you are engaging in.\n\n2. Your metabolism may have slowed down: The body adapts to changes in calorie intake and exercise, including lowering your metabolism if it feels like you are not getting enough food. This can make it harder to lose weight and may require more drastic changes to your diet and exercise.\n\n3. Your workout routine might not be effective enough: Although elliptical and treadmill are great cardiovascular exercises, it might not be enough to stimulate weight loss. You may want to incorporate strength training into your workout routine to help increase muscle mass, which can help boost your metabolism and burn more calories.\n\n4. You may have an underlying medical condition: Certain medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, can make weight loss more difficult. I would recommend checking with your doctor to rule out any medical conditions that could be affecting your weight loss progress.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind that weight loss can be a slow and gradual process, and it’s not always linear. Sometimes it takes time for the body to adjust to changes, so be patient and consistent with your efforts.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I wish you the best of luck on your weight loss journey.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As you have mentioned you are doing regular exercise and dieting, still no result, then it might be due to thyroid problem.

You can try taking supplements which will help you in the process of weight loss. Hope this information helps you, take care."

Overthinking can be a common issue for many people, especially when they are feeling stressed or anxious. It is important to address this issue so that you can get the restful sleep that your body needs. Here are a few tips that may help:\n\n1. Develop a bedtime routine: Create a bedtime routine that helps you wind down and relax before going to bed. This could include taking a warm bath/shower, reading a book, or practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation.\n\n2. Reduce screen time: Avoid using your phone or other electronic devices before bed. The blue light emitted from screens can disrupt your circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.\n\n3. Create a worry journal: Write down any worries or concerns that you have before going to bed. This can help you get them out of your mind and feel more in control.\n\n4. Avoid nicotine and caffeine: Nicotine and caffeine are both stimulants that can make it harder to fall asleep.\n\n5.

You can breastfeed your child more frequently or for longer duration, to ensure proper hydration. Reducing feeds is not recommended as it can interfere with weight gain and could lead to further dehydration.\n\nAscazin syrup is a vitamin supplement and does not have any direct role in the management of the current problem. However, it can help in improving overall health.\n\nTo manage pain while passing motion, you can try the following:\n\n1. Give more fluids to your child to avoid dehydration.\n\n2. Massage the baby's tummy with gentle circular motions.\n\n3. Place a warm cloth on the baby's tummy or a warm bath can also help relax the baby's muscles.\n\n4. Use a lubricant like petroleum jelly on the baby's anus to avoid injury during passage of stool.\n\n5.

You can treat it either by doing a root canal or get it removed as soon as possible. During the meantime, take Augmentin 625 (Amoxycillin with Clavulanic acid) twice daily for five days.

However, it's critical to address the issue before it becomes dangerous.\n\nI suggest that you see a dentist right away to get the necessary dental treatment.

X-ray of the involved region should be taken. Treatment depends upon the diagnosis. If it is due to gum infection then scaling and root planning with antibiotics will help.

Depending on the severity of the infection, it may be necessary to temporarily stop breastfeeding until the infection is completely treated.

It can help improve your physical performance and avoid pulmonary edema (shortness of breath during physical exertion). Anyway, as you have mild mitral valve stenosis, I would recommend anticoagulation therapy and follow up with your cardiologist with a cardiac ultrasound every six months.

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nMitral stenosis is a condition in which the mitral valve in the heart becomes narrow, limiting the flow of blood from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Treatment options for moderate mitral stenosis depend on the severity of the condition and the symptoms that you are experiencing.\n\nValvuloplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that is used to widen a narrowed valve in the heart. It can be performed using a balloon catheter. The procedure can improve the symptoms of mitral stenosis, but it may not completely cure the condition. Sometimes valvuloplasty needs to be repeated for further treatment.\n\nValvuloplasty can lead to a few complications such as bleeding, infection, and embolism. However, the risk of complications is relatively low for minimally invasive procedures like valvuloplasty.\n\nAs for your medication, Spiromide and tinormin are usually prescribed to lower blood pressure and reduce the symptoms of mitral stenosis. Your doctor may also prescribe other medications to help manage your symptoms.\n\nIt is important to speak with your doctor about your concerns and any questions you may have.

MRI scans show nothing and she is taking a maximum dosage of Endone. She now has vascular issues with bilateral inflammation and swelling in lower legs. She has been to a pain specialist and neurologist who have no answers. She is losing hope and trying to care for four children. Can you please offer us some answers?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand your concern and would explain that her symptoms (especially the grip loss in her arms and blurring vision) are not related to a lumbar spine disorder. A brain disorder (intracranial hypotension) or a cervical myelopathy could explain some of her symptoms. Intracranial hypotension could be a complication of local anesthesia, but you should know that it usually leads to a headache and blurring vision or nausea when standing up or sitting and the symptoms usually improve with lying down. So, it seems that her symptoms are not typical of this disorder too. Coming to this point, it is necessary to perform a brain MRI study and a cervical spine MRI study. The bilateral inflammation and swelling in her legs do not seem to be related to any neurological disorder. For this reason, it is important to perform inflammation tests (complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate) and a Doppler ultrasound of the leg vessels to investigate for chronic venous insufficiency. A cardiac ultrasound is necessary to exclude possible heart failure as a possible cause of increased fluid retention. Hope you will find this answer helpful. For more information consult a neurologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "I am sorry to hear that your daughter has been experiencing such debilitating symptoms for such a long time. It sounds like she has been through a lot.\n\nBased on the symptoms you have described, it is possible that your daughter may be suffering from a condition called arachnoiditis, which is inflammation of the arachnoid membrane that surrounds the spinal cord. This can be caused by spinal anesthesia or any other traumatic injury to the spine. The symptoms of arachnoiditis can be similar to those that your daughter is experiencing, including back pain, stiffness, loss of grip strength, shooting pains, and vision problems.\n\nUnfortunately, arachnoiditis is a difficult condition to diagnose and treat. MRI scans may not always show evidence of inflammation, and treatment options are often limited to managing symptoms with pain medication and physical therapy.\n\nHowever, it is important to rule out other conditions that may be contributing to your daughter's symptoms, such as a herniated disc or nerve damage. I would recommend that your daughter seek a second opinion from a neurosurgeon or spine specialist who is experienced in treating complex spine conditions. They may be able to offer additional diagnostic tests or treatment options that have not been considered yet.\n\nFurthermore, her vascular issue with bilateral inflammation and swelling in the lower legs warrants thorough evaluation as well by a vascular specialist.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and I wish your daughter the best of luck in finding relief from her symptoms.",

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! \n\nFirst of all, let me assure you that your insomnia, depression, and anxiety will not necessarily cause stunted growth. While chronic stress can have negative effects on physical health, it is unlikely to directly affect your height.\n\nThat being said, nutrition can certainly impact your height potential. Calcium and protein are essential for bone growth and development, so it is important to make sure you are getting enough of these nutrients.

        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Acne scar treatment depends on the type of scar. Boxcar scar is a superficial one. It can be treated with microdermabrasion combined with peel, and dermaroller. Ice pick scar is a small deep scar. It can be treated with TCA CROSS (Trichloro Acetic Acid chemical reconstruction of skin scars) procedure. Rolling scar needs subcision (minor surgical procedure) and fractional Co2 laser. Hypertrophic scar requires treatment using an intralesional injection of Triamcinolone acetonide to flatten it. Please attach your clinical picture soon so that I can guide you further. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! There are several treatments that can help reduce the appearance of acne scars. These include:\n\n1. Chemical peels: A chemical solution is used to peel away the top layer of skin, which can reduce the visibility of acne scars.\n\n2. Microdermabrasion: This treatment uses a machine to exfoliate the skin, removing dead skin cells and helping to reduce the appearance of scars.\n\n3. Laser treatments: Various types of laser treatments are available that can help resurface the skin and reduce the appearance of scars.\n\n4. Dermal fillers: Injectable fillers can be used to fill in depressed scars and improve their appearance.\n\n5. Microneedling: This treatment involves using a device with small needles to create tiny punctures in the skin, which can stimulate collagen production and improve the appearance of scars.\n\nIt's important to talk to a dermatologist about which treatment is best for your specific type of acne scars. They can help you come up with a plan that's tailored to your skin and your goals.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi there, Acne scarring is a difficult problem to solve. Treating acne can help reduce the severity of scarring but it cannot reverse the damage that has already been done. The best way to improve existing acne scars is with laser resurfacing or chemical peels. These procedures work by removing the top layers of skin and stimulating collagen growth in the deeper layers. This helps to gradually replace damaged tissue with healthy new skin. However, these procedures do require some downtime so they may not be suitable for everyone. I would recommend consulting your dermatologist who will be able to assess your condition and advise you accordingly."

He did a urine analysis, and some blood work and everything came back fine. There were no problems until three days ago. I peed then a few minutes later it felt like it still had to go so I went back to the toilet but I just got only blood. There was a lot this time, and it was fresh blood and small clots.It is hurting while passing the blood but that is all that came out though I had just emptied my bladder a few minutes before that. The only other symptom I seem to be having is all of a sudden there will be an immediate need to pee out of the blue but then when I go it is not a full bladder of pee just like half but it the onset was very sudden, or I am going to pee my pants.These are my only symptoms. I do have a long history of stones, but I am confident this is not due to that, because I have had blood from stones but not this amount of blood.

In case of any such bleeding, an ultrasound is a must. I prefer to start with a short course of antibiotics (mostly Nitrofurantoin and Cipro or Levofloxacin are given) for five days depending on sensitivity patterns. Blood clotting parameters need to be checked to see if you are on the overdose of Coumadin. Ultrasound is a must to rule out any other serious causes of bleeding like a tumor. Since antibiotics are not available over-the-counter in your place, you need to get back to your general physician.

To locate PC muscle, it is located in the perineum area behind the scrotum and in front of the anus. It is deep to skin and soft tissue, and urethra passes through this muscle. Hence contraction of this muscle helps to delay ejaculation by compressing urethra. The exercises for the PC muscles includes sitting with a straight back, both hands on lap. Squeeze in the anus as if trying to hold bowel while defecating. Hold and count to 10 and then slowly release the muscle. Do this for 6 to 10 times per sitting. Every day you can have 4 to 5 such sittings. While passing urine, what you can do is hold urine for 1 to 2 seconds, then, pass it, then again hold.

In severe cases, surgery is the best solution to relieve the pressure symptoms and to prevent complications such as urinary incontinence.

During the treatment, I was exposed to full of radiation, abdominal CT scan, lithotripsy, fluoroscopy, and another fluoroscopy during stent insertion. I am not sure how the doctor manages the radiation. I did my treatment abroad and it is not really a well-developed country. He might not even care bout it. I studied some about radiation when I was in dental school so I am very scared of the side effects.So if I am to have another case of hydronephrosis, should I just remove the kidney rather than undergoing such radiation which may cause me high risk of future cancer? Because as you can see, I am still so young and I just started my career. What do you suggest? Do the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa? Is there another less risky treatment in terms of radiation? How about invasive treatment? Is the risk higher aside from the slow healing? And I am serious about the removal if indeed it has lower radiation risk, even though I know kidney is very important. Please suggest.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. There are enough studies and literature which prove that though there is radiation exposure during CT (computed tomography) scan in the removal of kidney stone it is in low dose and chances of cancer do not increase. So do not worry about that. I do not think removing kidney to escape from radiation exposure is a good option. You should not think of that. If there is again stone formation then there is a treatment called ultrasound-guided lithotripsy (ESWL) which can break your stone from outside without any radiation exposure. So you can do ESWL (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) if required later but no need to remove the kidney.  Take care.",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! I understand your concerns regarding radiation exposure and its potential side effects. It is important to weigh the risks and benefits of any medical treatment, including those that involve radiation. \n\nIn terms of managing hydronephrosis, there may be alternative options to consider that involve less radiation exposure. For example, ultrasound imaging may be used to diagnose and monitor hydronephrosis, and can be repeated as needed without significant radiation exposure. In some cases, a kidney function study (nuclear renogram) may be used to evaluate kidney function and the presence of obstruction, which involves minimal radiation exposure. \n\nInvasive treatments, such as a surgical procedure to remove the obstruction or stent placement, may also be an option in some cases. These procedures involve risks such as bleeding, infection, and possible complications with anesthesia, but usually don't involve significant radiation exposure. \n\nThe decision to remove a kidney is a complex one and should be made after careful consideration of multiple factors, including the extent of the hydronephrosis and the overall health of the patient. Removal of a kidney may have potential long-term effects on kidney function and overall health, and is generally reserved as a last resort. \n\nIt's also important to note that radiation exposure from medical procedures is generally low and the risk of developing radiation-related cancer is small. However, it's always a good idea to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider and ask about any potential risks and benefits of any recommended treatments. \n\nI hope this information was helpful. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.",

        "answer_chatgpt": "As an AI language model, I am not a doctor and cannot provide medical advice. However, I can give you some general information about the risks of contracting HIV and the use of PEP.\n\nThe risk of contracting HIV from a single unprotected sexual encounter is relatively low, but it is not zero. The actual risk depends on various factors, such as the viral load of the person with HIV and the presence of other sexually transmitted infections.\n\nPost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a combination of antiretroviral drugs given to people who may have been exposed to HIV through sexual contact, needle-sharing, or other means. PEP can reduce the likelihood of HIV infection, but it is most effective when started as soon as possible after exposure (ideally within 72 hours) and taken consistently.\n\nIf you are concerned about your risk of HIV infection, it is best to talk to a healthcare provider who can evaluate your individual situation and recommend appropriate testing and treatment options.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "2nd possibility is that it depends on the route of transmission, if he had unprotected sex with another person then you need to be concerned about STD or HIV infection. The risk of being infected with HIV by sexual contact is 5-7%, but there is no reason to worry since you were protected. There is no need for PEP (post exposure prophylaxis) as your risk is very low.

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you have dengue. Dengue fever is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes that results in a sudden onset of fever, body aches, headache, and a rash. In some cases, it can cause a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood, which can lead to bleeding problems.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n- Fever fluctuations are common in dengue, and it's normal to experience it despite taking antipyretics like Paracetamol. It's essential to keep taking Paracetamol at regular intervals, as fever can cause dehydration and other complications. \n- Regarding hospital admission, it depends on the severity of your symptoms and platelet count. Usually, hospitalization is recommended if the platelet count drops below 100,000/cmm, and there are signs of bleeding or hemoconcentration. However, if you experience severe symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, or difficulty breathing, you should seek medical attention immediately. \n- The body usually starts producing new platelets after 2-3 days of illness. However, the recovery period may vary from person to person, and factors like age, overall health, and the severity of the infection can affect it.\n- Fluids therapy is necessary to prevent dehydration and maintain the fluid balance in the body. It's a supportive measure that can help the body fight the infection and produce new blood cells, including platelets.\n\nPlease follow your doctor's recommendations, keep yourself well-hydrated, rest adequately, and continue taking medication. Regular follow-up with your doctor and monitoring of your platelet count is crucial, especially if it continues to decrease. I hope you recover soon.",

        "answer_chatgpt": "Yes, based on the results of your blood test and symptoms, it is possible that you have some form of anemia. Anemia occurs when there is a decrease in the number of red blood cells or a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. The low hemoglobin, MCHC, RBC, and HCT values on your blood test are all consistent with anemia. The high RDW value may indicate that there is a mix of different red blood cell sizes, which is also characteristic of anemia. The low iron saturation value suggests that your body may not be getting enough iron, which is necessary for the production of red blood cells. It is important to follow up with your doctor to determine the underlying cause of your anemia and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

Long story short, she performed oral on me for about 30 seconds and I performed oral on her for maybe about the same, less than a minute, no intercourse. About two weeks after my friend came down with a cold and so did my brother, that Sunday I felt a little weird too but had gone to the beach. At the beach, I ended up swallowing a lot of seawater accidentally. That entire week I had headaches, stomach felt weird every time I ate and a little sore throat. So my mind went back to the day I met that girl and started freaking out. Three weeks after my oral exposure, I did an HIV RNA test with a fourth generation duo combo test and came back negative. My headaches continued for a little over two weeks on and off. After 25 days of the exposure, she did RNA and fourth generation which also came back negative. During the fourth week, I did another fourth-generation myself and also negative again. On week five, I went to a clinic, did a rapid blood drawn test and a NAAT test, and all came back negative. Week six (42 days) did another fourth generation and was negative. 52 days little over seven weeks I went and did an HIV 2 RNA test, and today at 53 days did an HIV RNA test and fourth generation duo.

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello, it sounds like you may have strained or pulled a muscle in your lower back. The symptoms you describe, such as sharp pain when moving, bending or walking, are consistent with this type of injury. To help alleviate the pain, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as directed on the label. Applying heat or cold to the affected area can also help reduce the pain and inflammation. It is important to avoid any activities that aggravate the pain, and to rest and allow the injured area to heal. If the pain persists or worsens, or if you experience other symptoms such as numbness or tingling in your leg, I would recommend that you seek medical attention from your healthcare provider. They can perform a physical exam and recommend additional treatments, such as physical therapy or medications, to help you recover.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Dear Patient this could be a muscular injury as you have mentioned. But it could also be a sciatica problem which needs to be ruled out by MRI. In case of muscular injury, rest is required for at least 4-5 days along with analgesics like ibuprofen. In case of sciatic nerve compression, surgical decompression has to be done after MRI. So I would suggest you to consult your physician who can examine and treat you accordingly."

        "input": "Hello doctor,My husband and I will be using a surrogate to have kids. My husband is kell positive (heterozygous). What are the risks to this that the surrogate would need to be aware of?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. Few points include: 1. As per medical facts, the first pregnancy remains silent. In your case surrogate is kell negative it means her body is still not exposed to kell antigens which are good, so this pregnancy will be safe. 2. As the husband is heterozygous, it means he has only a 50 % chance of having baby kell positive. In the rest 50 %, there is no risk of complications. So, theoretically, this pregnancy should go silent without complications. But then surrogate will be exposed to kell antigen from your husband, she should be aware of this risk which can create trouble in future pregnancies if the male is kell positive.  Take care.",
        "answer_chatgpt": "If your husband is heterozygous for the Kell antigen, he may produce antibodies against the Kell antigen, which can be harmful to a Kell-positive fetus or newborn. This is known as Kell isoimmunization or Kell alloimmunization.\n\nIf the surrogate is Kell-positive, there is a risk that the fetus could also be Kell-positive, which could trigger Kell alloimmunization in your husband. This can cause hemolytic disease in the fetus or newborn, which could result in severe anemia, jaundice, brain damage, and even death.\n\nYour doctor will likely recommend that the surrogate undergo a blood test to determine her Kell status. If she is Kell-negative, the risk of Kell alloimmunization is significantly reduced. However, if she is Kell-positive, your doctor may recommend that your husband undergo genetic counseling and possibly receive prophylactic treatment to reduce the risk of Kell alloimmunization.\n\nIt is important to discuss these risks with your doctor and seek their advice on the best course of action for your specific situation.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  It is not possible for him to transmit antigen to the baby, and he should not worry about transmitting any disease to the child. He can even work as a father if the surrogate mother has no such antigens in her body. So there is nothing to worry about his condition.  As far as the surrogate mother is concerned she might develop some reaction against your husbands blood group antigens during pregnancy. But it is very rare to happen. Even if happens she may require only few doses of anti-serum which will help her to overcome that problem.  Hope this helps you. Wishing good health to both of you."

        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. From the description, it seems that you had confidence regarding the exams before some days. But it seems that, for now, you have lost your confidence. Why have you lost your confidence? Is it because of other people who try to demotivate you? Is it because you could not perform well in mock tests? In any of the case, do not worry or think too much. The answer to your question is simple. You will score good marks if you have prepared well. You will score low marks if your performance is low and medium marks if your performance is medium. That simple. There is one more limelight. You have prepared 60 % and if almost all the questions are from the portion that you have prepared, there is still a chance of scoring 90 %. So do not be demotivated. You still have time. Last minute preparation provides more insight and knowledge. All the best.  Take care.",

The doctor asked me for a testosterone and GH test. The result came back a week later and it said that I had a low HGH level and a 21/42 level testosterone. Is this normal for an 18 year old male? I was devastated that my growth plates were closed, because I also had an x-ray of left hand. My doctor asked me whether I am sexually active. I answered him no. But, I got a doubt regarding erectile dysfunction. Am I suffering from erectile dysfunction? Should I be worried? Is my testosterone too low? How can I increase testosterone? I had torsion three years back and nothing back happened. But, this could be a factor. Another factor may be that I used to hold my mobile phone in my pocket all the time.I am a sprint athlete and have defined leg muscles, but this could be due to my short stature.

However, it is important to note that testosterone levels can vary throughout the day and may be affected by factors such as exercise, stress, and sleep. \n\nRegarding erectile dysfunction, it is not necessarily related to your testosterone levels. It is important to talk to your doctor about any concerns you have regarding your sexual function as there can be several factors that lead to erectile dysfunction such as psychological, hormonal, or vascular issues. Your doctor may recommend further tests or refer you to a specialist if needed. \n\nRegarding your HGH levels, a low level can contribute to decreased growth in height. The follow-up blood test you mention may provide more information about your HGH levels. If your levels are consistently low, your doctor may consider treatment options such as HGH therapy, but this would require a detailed evaluation and discussion.\n\nThere are several ways to increase testosterone levels, such as maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, and reducing stress. However, it is important to note that increasing testosterone levels should only be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional.\n\nRegarding your torsion, it is unlikely to have an impact on your hormones. However, it is important to mention any past medical conditions or surgeries to your doctor so they have a complete picture of your health history.\n\nLastly, carrying your mobile phone in your pocket is not known to affect testosterone levels or growth in height.\n\nI hope this information helps. Please discuss your concerns with your doctor and follow their recommendations.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Your age is 18 years, and your height is 173 cm. You should be able to grow at least half a foot more if you continue growing till 20 or 22 years of age. So, if you do not grow now then there is no chance of further growth. Testosterone level is normal. There is no need to worry about your sexual activity. Erectile dysfunction is common with aging, and it has nothing to do with your testosterone level. You have to consult your orthopedic surgeon and get evaluated for your short stature."

To summarize the report, it says there is a decreased functioning of the heart, which most commonly occurs due to coronary artery disease or sometimes due to the weakening of the heart muscle. So, he should get his evaluation done, ECG (electrocardiogram), lipid profile, sugars both fasting and post lunch, and angiography. He should be on medicine to prevent further decline in the heart functions which includes Aspirin, Clopidogrel, statins like Atorvastatin, beta blockers like Metoprolol, ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitor like Ramipril, and diuretics like Spironolactone, etc. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts. For more information consult a cardiologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! \n\nBased on the report you have provided, here is what it means:\n\n1. Mildly dilated LA: This means that the left atrium (LA) of the heart is slightly enlarged. An enlarged LA may be a sign of underlying heart problems.\n\n2. Normal LV size: The left ventricle (LV) of the heart is the main pumping chamber. Normal LV size indicates that it is not enlarged.\n\n3. Moderately reduced function: This means that the left ventricle is not functioning as well as it should be. The reduced function indicates that the heart is not pumping blood efficiently, which can lead to problems.\n\n4. Mild MR: MR stands for mitral regurgitation, which is a condition in which blood flows backward into the heart. Mild MR means that the amount of blood flowing backward is not severe.\n\n5. LVDD II: LVDD stands for left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which means that the left ventricle is not filling with blood properly during its resting phase. LVDD II is a mild form of diastolic dysfunction.\n\nOverall, the report suggests that your father has mild heart problems, including an enlarged LA, moderately reduced LV function, mild MR, and mild diastolic dysfunction. He should follow up with a cardiologist to determine the underlying cause of these issues and plan on any necessary treatment.",

It is advisable first to get a reflux study done to find the grade of reflux. 2. The initial medications to be given in reflux are Zantac (Ranitidine) and Perinorm (Metoclopramide). In most cases, this works. The next step beyond this is Gaviscon (antacid) and feed thickening. 3. Also very important is to keep the child in a slightly upright position (30 degrees to ground) after feeding (and most of the time) to reduce the amount of discomfort the child may be facing due to reflux. This one method goes a long way in helping chil ChatDoctor.  As the child grows bigger, the need for this reduces eventually. 4. As regards to the crying episodes during stools, if the stools are hard or if there is gas the child may cry. Both are less likely due to the enzymes.

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! I'm sorry to hear that your baby is having some digestive issues. It sounds like he may be experiencing some discomfort due to the gas and reflux. \n\nOne thing you could try is eliminating the formula and sticking with only pumped milk. Some babies have a hard time digesting formula, and it can cause gas and spit-up. It may take a few days to see if this helps, but it is something to consider.\n\nAnother thing to try is to make sure your baby is getting a good burp after every feeding. Sometimes babies need to be burped multiple times during a feeding. You could also try holding him in an upright position for 20-30 minutes after a feeding to help with reflux.\n\nIn terms of the lack of bowel movements, it is not uncommon for breastfed babies to go several days without a bowel movement. However, if your baby seems uncomfortable and is straining to poop, you can try some gentle tummy massage and leg bicycling to help him pass stool. If you're concerned, don't hesitate to contact your pediatrician for further advice.\n\nAs for the Colicaid and Yamoo, these are both commonly used to help with colic and gas. However, every baby is unique and may respond differently. If you are not seeing improvement, you can discuss other options with your pediatrician.\n\nOverall, it's important to remember that digestive issues in babies are common and often resolve on their own as their digestive system develops. It may take some trial and error to find what works best for your baby, so don't hesitate to reach out to your pediatrician for guidance.",

He sent me to a root canal specialist who found that the tooth is cracked and needs to be removed. Given that the infection was under the tooth in the bone, was it appropriate to do a root canal before checking whether it would solve the problem?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Your chief complaint in itself suggests tooth was infected so there were two treatment modalities: RCT (root canal treatment) or extraction. As the doctor has done RCT and problem has not solved, it can be due to accessory root canals difficult to negotiate or perforation due to faulty RCT procedure. The endodontist after examination arrived at the conclusion of a cracked tooth. So, he advised extraction. As for your question is concerned the doctor has tried best at first instance to save the tooth and it is a routine which dentists do. But based on the complexity he was not able to solve it. Under such cases we dentists extract tooth particularly in case of third molars which has much complicated anatomy. ",

Therefore, removing the tooth is usually the best option to resolve the infection if it persists after a root canal, and the tooth is found to be cracked.\n\nYour dentist took appropriate steps in diagnosing and addressing the issue with the infected tooth. The decision to perform the root canal procedure first before determining the need for removal would depend on the initial diagnosis and treatment plan.

Root canal treatment is done to remove the infected tissue from inside the tooth and cleaning the canals to prevent further spread of infection. In case if there is any infection left behind, then the tooth becomes painful and sometimes may cause swelling also. So as per your symptoms, it seems that you need to get the tooth extracted.

I am also using Chlorhexamed forte.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello,  Welcome to ChatDoctor.  I understand your concern. The loosely attached swollen gums over the wisdom tooth is called as pericoronitis. The age of eruption of wisdom teeth is from 17 to 21 years. Beyond that, if the wisdom tooth has not erupted or half erupted gives out pain or swelling, it is highly likely to be locked inside the jaw.  Since they are the last ones to erupt, most of them do not get enough space to erupt and tries anyways and this causes jaw pain, swelling and sometimes the surrounding structures like same side temple, ear and throat also gives out pain. This wisdom tooth is called an impacted tooth. During the first visit, antibiotics and painkillers will be prescribed. The swelling will come down eventually but if that is impacted, it may not come down. Please visit your dentist and get an x-ray of your wisdom tooth to check whether there is enough space for it to erupt and to check whether it is erupting in the right direction. Taking painkillers and antibiotics will help to control pain and swelling but if the tooth is impacted, this will not be a permanent solution. You may require wisdom tooth removal.  I hope this helps. ",

If you have been taking the antibiotics for two days and you are not experiencing any improvement, it is important to follow up with your dentist as soon as possible. Your dentist may need to re-evaluate the situation and potentially prescribe a different antibiotic or a higher dose. In the meantime, you can continue taking the Ibuprofen as directed by your dentist and using the Chlorhexamed forte for pain relief and to promote healing. Make sure to practice good oral hygiene habits and avoid eating or drinking foods that may irritate the affected area.",

He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22.

Based on the details and the labs attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it seems very unlikely that the symptoms are coming from a thyroid issue. Urine iodine is really not helpful clinically in this case.

        "answer_chatgpt": "I understand your concerns regarding your son's symptoms and the possibility of a thyroid problem. Low iodine and selenium levels can contribute to thyroid dysfunction, but it is not clear if they are the cause of your son's symptoms. It is worth consulting with an endocrinologist to further evaluate your son's thyroid function and explore any potential treatment options. However, given your son's severe panic around doctors, it may be beneficial to work on addressing his anxiety symptoms first before pursuing further medical evaluation. A therapist experienced in treating anxiety disorders may be helpful in this regard. Additionally, managing stressors and improving sleep hygiene can also be beneficial for managing anxiety symptoms.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. The blood levels of thyroid hormones are not always accurate in people with anxiety. In such cases, an ultrasound scan of the neck can be done which can help in differentiating between a normal thyroid gland and enlargement of the thyroid gland due to inflammation or goiter. In case of enlargement of the thyroid gland, the treatment is simple. It consists of taking anti-inflammatory medicines like steroids along with thyroxine. This is called as subclinical hyperthyroidism. In case of thyroiditis, the thyroid function tests may come back normal but there might be some changes seen on thyroid ultrasound. These are transient conditions and resolve over a period of time without any specific treatment. Do discuss the above with your doctor. Hope this helps."

I cannot recommend using any natural remedies for a stone of this size though they will not affect the stent.

Some natural remedies, such as certain herbs or substances, may interact with your current medications or have other side effects.\n\nIn terms of anesthesia for a procedure such as stent placement or removal, the choice of anesthesia depends on several factors, including the patient's preferences and medical history, the type of procedure, and the surgeon's recommendation. Local anesthesia, which numbs only a specific area of the body, may be used for stent placement or removal in some cases. However, this decision would ultimately be up to your surgeon.\n\nRegarding your question about whether kidney stones can come out from behind, it is possible for stones to move within the urinary tract and cause a blockage, which can lead to complications such as infection or kidney damage. However, it is important to remember that each case is unique, and the likelihood of a stone being able to move or pass depends on several factors, including the size and location of the stone, the size of the ureter (the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder), and the patient's overall health.\n\nRegarding your diabetes, it is important to continue taking your medications as prescribed and to work with your healthcare provider to manage your blood sugar levels.

When I say scared, I mean night terrors, huge anxiety, and no appetite (lost 15 pounds in three weeks). I cannot work and it is all I think about. The circumstances are as follows. I performed oral sex on a female. I then fingered her and then masturbated myself with the same hand. I have asked a few professionals and they say I am only at risk theoretically but have no real risk of contracting HIV. However, my body tells me differently. I have had a sore throat for 20 days, no appetite, pain where my liver and spleen are, weakness in my legs that come and go and a hint of nausea every now and then. I have night sweats that awaken me but they are accompanied by panic. My heart feels like it is going to burst. My tongue and mouth burn, but I think that is acid-related because my breath is awful, no matter how much I brush. I had an Alere combo HIV test at 25 days and that was negative. I have never had a fever, rash, swollen nodes, or any of the common symptoms. My questions are what is my real risk of contracting HIV? The health department said I do not need to retest and that 25 days was enough time for accurate results with that type of test. Is that true? Could this all be anxiety and guilt?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand that you are worried but it is not the end of the world. Hope this helps. Take care. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing such intense anxiety and fear about your sexual encounter. It sounds like you've gotten conflicting information from professionals, which can be confusing and increase anxiety.\n\nBased on the details you've provided, the risk of contracting HIV from performing oral sex on a female is considered low, but not zero. This is because saliva contains enzymes that can break down and inactivate the virus, but there is still a theoretical risk if there was blood or other bodily fluids present. Fingering and masturbating do not typically transmit HIV, unless there was blood or other bodily fluids present and there were open wounds or breaks in the skin.\n\nYour negative HIV test at 25 days is encouraging, but it's important to note that the window period for HIV can vary and some people may take longer to develop detectable antibodies. The health department may have recommended against retesting because the Alere combo test is considered highly sensitive and specific, but a repeat test at a later time period (such as 3 months post-exposure) could provide additional reassurance.\n\nIt's possible that your physical symptoms could be related to anxiety and stress, which can manifest in physical ways. However, it's also important to rule out any medical causes for your symptoms, especially if they persist or worsen. I would recommend discussing your symptoms with a healthcare provider and possibly getting a physical exam and other tests as needed.\n\nLastly, it's important to seek support for your emotional well-being as well. Infidelity and potential exposure to HIV can be very distressing and it's important to have resources to help cope with these feelings. This could include therapy, support groups, or talking with trusted friends or family members.\n\nI hope this information is helpful and reassuring. Please feel free to ask any follow-up questions or concerns.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) There is no such thing as theoretical risk of hiv transmission through oral sex.2) You have been tested at 25 days from your exposure and the result is negative.

Because one moment, while we were having sex, I felt myself without the condom but when I pulled out the condom, no drop was fallen. Because of this, I had given her I-pill and she had taken it around 48 hours after the sex. But it was on the second day from her date of the period.

However, taking the pill within 48 hours after unprotected sex greatly reduces the risk of pregnancy.\n\nIt is also important to confirm whether the condom was broken or not. If there is any uncertainty about the effectiveness of the condom, both partners should get tested for sexually transmitted infections.\n\nIf your fiancee's period is significantly delayed, it is recommended that she take a pregnancy test. If the test is negative and her period still hasn't arrived after a few more days, she should see her healthcare provider to rule out any underlying health conditions that could be causing the delay.",

Ideally, filling procedures do not work for gum recession problems but only for decay or abrasions close to the gum lines. The reason why fillings are not recommended is that you lose normal shiny tooth surface and the bulk while the cavities are prepared and there are many chances that the filling material might show microleakage hence paving way for tooth decay. There are as such no particular risks for this kind of procedures with your medical history kept in mind.

After trying several medications Depakote was the one that worked best. My ex-husband got custody of him 4 years ago and pulled him off from his medication. Last month my son threatened suicide and was hospitalized and placed on Zoloft. I recently spoke with my son\\s counselor and she said that Zoloft is used to treat depression and that he should be on a secondary medication for bipolar. His past medicines are Intuniv and Depakote and his current medicines are Zoloft and Vyvanse. I have tried speaking with my son\\s therapist. However, my ex-husband has told her not to speak to me regarding my son\\s treatment. I have noticed in conversations as well as visits with my son that he sometimes seems more depressed and agitated even threatening to run away from home. Is Zoloft used to treat bipolar without any secondary medication? Is it safe for a 13 year old?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. First of all, I want to inform you that Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) and Intuniv (Guanfacine) tablets are indicated for Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Depakote (Valproic acid) is an antiepileptic and mood stabilizer. It is useful for bipolar disorder. If your child is diagnosed with bipolar, then he should receive Depakote or other mood stabilizer. Zoloft (Sertraline) is an antidepressant and by this chance of switch to mania is there. So, in bipolar patients if depressive symptoms are prominent, then antidepressant can be given only under the cover of mood stabilizer. Antidepressant should not be used for long term in bipolar patients. Once depressive symptoms get resolve, patient should maintain only on mood stabilizer. Antidepressant should get taper off gradually. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello, I understand your concerns regarding your son's medication for bipolar disorder. Zoloft (sertraline) is an antidepressant medication that is frequently used in combination with other medications for bipolar disorder, but it is not typically used as the sole medication for bipolar disorder. It is important to note, however, that each individual's symptoms and the nature of their bipolar disorder can vary, and the medication regimen will depend on the specific needs and response of the patient under the care of a certified professional.\n\nWhile Zoloft is considered generally safe, there are risks associated with the use of antidepressants in children and adolescents, including an increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior. Therefore, it is critical that your son's healthcare practitioner closely monitor any potential side effects, changes in symptoms, and overall response to the medication.\n\nIt is also concerning that your ex-husband has prohibited your son's therapist from speaking with you regarding your son's treatment. It is important for all parties involved in the care of your son to communicate and work collaboratively to ensure that he receives the best possible care.\n\nIn summary, while Zoloft can be an effective medication for treating depression, it is typically used in conjunction with other medications for bipolar disorder. It is crucial that your son's healthcare provider closely monitors his symptoms and response to the medication, and that there is ongoing communication between all parties involved in his care.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) Zoloft is an antidepressant, so it may not be the right choice if your child is suffering from bipolar disorder.2) Secondary medication for bipolar can include lithium or valproate (Depakote).

Secondly, we can always have a breast implant surgery if nothing works on the medical side. Ask her to eat a well-balanced diet. Stop worrying. For more information consult an endocrinologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "I'm sorry to hear that your sister is going through this. It's important to note that breast development can vary among girls and can take up to five years after the onset of puberty to complete. However, if your sister is seriously concerned about her breast development or if she has had no signs of breast development by the age of 16, it is best to have her evaluated by a pediatrician or an adolescent medicine specialist.\n\nThe doctor may order some hormone tests to check if there is a lack of estrogen production or an abnormality in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, which can interfere with breast development. If there is a hormonal imbalance, treatment with estrogen or other medications may be recommended.\n\nIt's also important to address your sister's emotional well-being. It sounds like her concerns are impacting her mental health, and counseling or therapy may be beneficial for her. Encourage her to talk to a counselor or mental health professional about her feelings and fears regarding her breast development.\n\nIt's understandable that this situation can be distressing for your sister, but with proper medical evaluation, support, and reassurance, she can get the help she needs.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern regarding your sisters problem. At this age, there should be some sort of growth in the breasts. But since they do not have any growth, we need to rule out other causes before we start treating them. So I would suggest you to get an ultrasound done first which will help us know if there is anything abnormal happening inside the breasts or not. In case if that doesn't show any abnormality then we can consider giving her hormonal treatment. Hope this helps you. Feel free to revert in case you need any further clarification."

So, it is unlikely going to spread and will heal completely in two weeks. Prednisolone is a steroid and can cause reactivation of Shingles. So you need to take Acyclovir at least for one week and continue Prednisolone and Humira (Adalimumab) until your IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) goes in remission. Then you can slowly decrease the dose of Prednisolone and finally take it off. You can go on a trip. ",

        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. According to your history, the pulp is exposed and decayed by now. It means sensations are lost and that is why you are not feeling pain in it. But it does not mean your tooth cannot get an infection now. It can get infected because of the food stuck in it can cause infection in gums around broken tooth and root. That may be very painful. Therefore, I will advise you to visit your dentist and get it extracted or treated according to your clinical condition. ",

However, a dead tooth (one whose pulp has been compromised or has died) doesn't always result in pain, and pain might not be the only indicator of a potential problem. The absence of discomfort will not necessarily indicate whether or not a tooth is dead. If you are concerned about the health of your tooth, you should schedule an appointment with your dentist, who will be able to evaluate your teeth and provide advice and treatment options. Your dentist may recommend x-rays or other tests to assess the health of your tooth and determine whether immediate treatment is necessary.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, Thanks for writing in. The exposure of the pulp can be due to many reasons like trauma, deep decay, fractured teeth etc. The best treatment option would be Root canal treatment if there is no infection and if the root is intact. If the pulp is exposed then there is a chance of getting an abscess which will give rise to pain. If the pulp is already necrotic then there is no point of doing a root canal as it will not help. You can get your tooth extracted and go for implant placement for replacement of the missing tooth."

The triggering event seems to be the discontinuation of 150 mg Bupropion because of adverse effects. I switched to 20 mg Citalopram, and over the course of six months, I reduced Citalopram to less than 1.5 mg. However, the sexual dysfunction has remained unchanged. I previously took Citalopram in doses ranging from 10 to 20 mg, depending on the external stress, for six years, and this did not cause significant sexual side effects, except delayed orgasm. While on Bupropion, my semen production stopped, but there were no marked changes in sexual desire, arousal, or behavior. The Citalopram and Bupropion had been prescribed for anxiety and depression, which have been well controlled for many years. Six months after the onset of the sexual dysfunction, a testosterone test revealed total testosterone in the 400s and free testosterone beyond the laboratory\\s ability to measure it (highly elevated >100). I do not use androgen supplements and illegal or recreational drug. There is no history of alcohol addiction or nicotine use.

You may also want to discuss with your healthcare provider the option of trying non-pharmacological treatments for anxiety and depression, such as therapy or cognitive-behavioral strategies. There are also medications that can help improve sexual function, such as phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, but these would need to be discussed with your healthcare provider and weighed against any potential risks for interactions with your current medications.",

Nasya is a kind of panchakarma treatment where the oil is poured in the nostrils. Raktamokshan is a procedure of bloodletting.

The massage can also promote sweating, which can help eliminate toxins through the skin. The organs involved in eliminating toxins from the body are the liver, kidneys, lungs, lymphatic system, and skin. The liver is responsible for metabolizing and detoxifying substances before they are eliminated through the kidneys or intestines. The kidneys filter waste products and excess fluids from the blood, which are then eliminated through the urine. The lungs help to eliminate carbon dioxide and other gas waste products through respiration. The lymphatic system removes toxins and waste materials from tissues and transports them to the lymph nodes for elimination. And finally, the skin also plays a role in eliminating toxins through sweating.",

        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! The ability to grow a full beard is largely dependent on genetics and testosterone levels. Testosterone is the hormone that stimulates and controls the growth of facial hair, and genetics determine how sensitive the hair follicles are to testosterone.\n\nSome men may have lower levels of testosterone or less sensitivity to the hormone, which can result in thin or patchy beard growth. Other factors such as age, health, and diet may also play a role in beard growth.\n\nNot being able to grow a full beard can potentially impact men psychologically, causing feelings of inadequacy or emasculation.

Some chronic low-grade nausea that can disappear for weeks at a time and is not usually accompanied by a headache. I went through the gamut with GP, he then referred me to an ENT, and then to a neurologist. I am still getting some headaches but have had a clear CT scan of sinuses. A full neurological exam was done and that was normal, and the neurologist did not seem to think that additional imaging (MRI) was needed because my exam was normal.Even though it was a CT scan of the sinuses, they would have seen the brain (particularly frontal lobe) and notified of any abnormalities they could see.

Coming to your straightforward query, I really do not see any indication for a fresh brain imaging study like CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in view of your transient, very short lasting symptoms and a normal MRI brain, just one year back. Instead, I would suggest here to get one electroencephalogram (EEG) done to look for abnormal electrical discharges in the brain during those episodes. EEG done during the time frame when you are frequently having those episodes will be more rewarding in terms of diagnostic importance. With a normal neurological examination and normal MRI, you should stay calm and assured that it is nothing serious. Lastly and importantly, anxiety is the commonest cause of such symptoms.

Migraine headaches can cause a range of symptoms including lightheadedness and vertigo, and facial pressure and stabbing headaches could also be consistent with migraine attacks. However, there are other potential causes for these symptoms as well, such as inner ear disorders, anxiety or stress-related symptoms, or even medications.\n\nThe fact that you've had a clear CT scan and MRI is reassuring, and does suggest that a structural problem is less likely. However, it's important to consider that certain conditions may not be visible on imaging studies. If your symptoms persist or worsen, or if you develop any other concerning symptoms, it may be worth discussing further evaluation with your healthcare provider. That being said, if you are feeling reassured by your normal medical evaluations to date, it's reasonable to continue monitoring your symptoms for now and seeking follow-up care as needed.\n\nIt's also worth noting that many conditions that cause symptoms such as headache and dizziness can be managed with lifestyle modifications (e.g., changes to diet, sleep habits, stress management), medication adjustments, or other non-invasive interventions. Your healthcare provider can work with you to develop a plan that is tailored to your individual needs and goals.",

The plantar fascia is a thick band of tissue that runs from the heel to the toes and supports the arch of the foot. When this tissue becomes irritated, it can cause inflammation and pain.\n\nCortisone injections and special boots are standard treatments for plantar fasciitis, but they do not always provide relief for everyone. In some cases, surgery may be necessary.\n\nAn MRI can be helpful in diagnosing and evaluating the severity of plantar fasciitis. It can show if there is any degeneration or tearing of the plantar fascia or if there is a problem with the surrounding soft tissues.\n\nLevoxyl is a medication used to treat low thyroid hormone levels, and Paxil is an antidepressant medication. These medications are not directly related to plantar fasciitis but may have an impact on pain perception and management.\n\nI suggest discussing your MRI results with your doctor to determine the best course of treatment for your condition.\n\nTake care.",

I can also see that the base of the nose is a bit too broad and gives a feeling of oddly joined fractured segments. This can be confirmed by few X-rays. Further correction if this is as well simple.

A broken nose can definitely affect the symmetry of your facial features, especially if it was not treated properly or if the injury caused significant damage to the nasal bones or cartilage. If left untreated, a broken nose can heal in a way that causes the nose to twist or bend, making one side of the face appear larger or smaller than the other. \n\nIt is also possible that the injury may have affected the muscles and soft tissues around your nose, leading to an imbalance in your facial expression. This can include the muscles that control your smile, making one side appear different from the other.\n\nTo determine the cause and potential treatment options for your asymmetry, you may want to schedule a consultation with a plastic surgeon or facial plastic surgeon. They can examine your nose and facial features and recommend possible treatments, such as surgery or injectable fillers, to improve the symmetry and balance of your face.",

I think it will take time to teach people to understand the importance of nutrition labeling but with my experience, I can answer your questions from the way I have understood by my patients. Misconception spreads mainly through advertisement. People does not read and they want to just understand what media say. The trend of looking into calorie content is increasing mostly on our IT people. I would prefer calories from sugar, calories from fat and sodium content of product per 200 g. About calories, I think we need to teach each detail of sources of fat, sodium and potassium levels. I guess all medical professionals need to teach the importance of reading, food labeling as we can observe an increase rate of metabolic disorder. If we guide in the proper way it could be helpful, it might be in schools or some awareness programs. A small note on the ingredient used and its importance or guiding note on macro as well as micronutrient uses in points.

What do you think is the most common and most damaging misconception people have when it comes to purchasing food in the supermarket?\n\nOne of the most common misconceptions is that food products that are advertised as \"low-fat,\" \"reduced-fat,\" or \"light\" are healthier options. In reality, many of these products may have added sugars, making them just as unhealthy as their full-fat counterparts.\n\n2. Do you think that people focus too much on calorie counting and not enough on eating healthy foods? If you can include only three things in a nutritional label, what would you choose?\n\nCalorie counting is an essential part of maintaining a healthy weight, but it is not the only aspect of healthy eating. It is important to focus on the quality of the calories you consume, and not just the quantity. If I could only include three things in a nutritional label, I would choose total sugars, ingredients, and serving size.\n\n3. In your experience, what do people mostly focus on when studying nutritional labels, calories, fats, or sodium? What do you think they should be focusing on the most?\n\nPeople tend to focus on calories and fat content when studying nutritional labels, but they should also pay attention to the sugar and sodium content. Foods with high levels of added sugar and sodium can lead to health problems like high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\n4. In your opinion, how can people make more educated decisions when grocery shopping? Do you think the nutritional label is enough to rely on?\n\nReading the nutritional labels is a great start, but people should also pay attention to the ingredients list and try to choose whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible. It is also important to educate oneself on what constitutes a healthy, balanced diet.\n\n5. If you were to design a completely new nutritional label, how would you make it easier to understand or read than the previous five examples of nutritional labels? Do you have any suggestions?\n\nSome suggestions for a more user-friendly nutritional label include displaying the total and added sugar content separately, and providing clear and concise information on the serving size and number of servings per package.\n\n6. Of the many food trends that constantly spring up, should the average consumer believe any slogan slapped across the packaging of food products? What are some tell-tale signs to be aware of?\n\nConsumers should be wary of slogans like \"all natural\" or \"organic,\" as they do not always guarantee that the product is healthy. It is important to read the ingredients list and nutritional labels to get a complete picture of what is in the food product.",

This can be a cardiac arrhythmia like PSVT (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. And one may get symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain or heaviness, dizziness, etc. Are you having ventricular or atrial ectopics? Have you undergone echo? Presence of ectopics also suggests the possibility of these arrhythmias. Usually, ECG is normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) as it is done in between the episodes or may show ectopics. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You may request for portable cardiac monitor either Holter or another mobile-based rhythm monitor especially during intercourse to see the rhythm is recurring. Alternatively, you may undergo treadmill test and we can see if it recurs during the running.  Also, thyroid test should be done if not had recently. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Next time, you have this, focus on heart rate and measure pulse rate. These arrhythmias are not life-threatening. So overall, that episode may be an episode atrial arrhythmia rather than panic attack and our priority is to confirm it by investigations.

        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi there, thanks for writing in. The symptoms you have mentioned are suggestive of a panic attack. It may occur during sexual arousal or orgasm due to increased blood flow to the brain. During erection, the penis is filled with blood and causes pressure changes in the bladder leading to urinary retention. Sometimes, this can cause sudden pressure on the abdomen leading to chest pain and breathing difficulty. So, in short, these symptoms may be related to any of the above reasons. But, since you have been diagnosed with ectopic beats, I would strongly recommend going for further investigations. ECG, stress test, echo etc. should be done to rule out cardiac problems. A psychiatrist consultation would help treat any associated anxiety issues. Hope this helps."

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The condom does not give 100 percent contraception. In fact, no contraception is 100 percent effective. Body to body and skin to skin contact will not result in STD (sexually transmitted disease), unless there are cuts over the body and body fluids get transmitted. Kissing will not cause STD. Deep throat and violent kissing might cause injuries and microbleeds and those might cause transmission of fluids across membranes and STD. Spa erotic massage is usually safe. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! Thank you for your questions. \n\nTo answer your first question, a condom is highly effective at preventing the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but it is not 100% safe. The effectiveness of a condom depends on several factors such as the type of STI, the type of condom, and how it is used. While condoms can greatly reduce the risk of STI transmission, they are not foolproof.\n\nRegarding your second question, it is possible to get some STIs through body-to-body or skin-to-skin contact, such as herpes or human papillomavirus (HPV). Therefore, it is important to use protective measures such as condoms and dental dams during sexual activities, even if penetration is not involved.\n\nRegarding your third question, STD transmission through kissing is generally considered rare. However, certain STIs such as herpes and syphilis can be transmitted through kissing if there are active sores or lesions in or around the mouth. Additionally, kissing can be a way of transmitting STIs if the person you are engaging in sexual activity with has an STI in their throat or mouth.\n\nAs for your final question, it is difficult to assess the safety of spa erotic massage as it depends on the establishment and its practices. The risk of STI transmission can be increased in settings that do not practice safe sex measures, including the use of condoms and proper sanitation. It is important to remember that even in an intimate setting, such as a massage, it is still important to practice safe sex measures to protect against STI transmission.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1. No, condoms are not 100 percent safe. They reduce the risk of transmission but can fail at times and can cause some STDs like Chlamydia and gonorrhea.2. Yes, skin to skin contact and mucous membrane to mucous membrane contact can transmit STDs.3. Kissing is generally safe unless there is blood in the mouth from gums, teeth, tongue or throat.4. Erotic massages are safe if they are being provided by someone who is not infected with STDs."

        "input": "Hello doctor,Five weeks ago, I fell down while mountain-biking. I went over the handlebars and hit my head and chest. I was wearing a helmet and a chest protector and both of them had cracked as a result of the impact. The helmet strap had strangulated my neck pretty hard. Ever since I have been continuously having sensation pressure at the place where the strap had impacted. Activities like turning my neck, yawning, laughing cause some pain. Over the past five weeks, the symptoms have not improved. I am very worried because I am afraid I might have to deal with this forever. They did a CT scan and said that it was normal. Should I ask for an MRI? Could this be some kind of hernia?",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi. Sorry to hear about your injury. Since your CT (computed tomography) scan is normal, it is very unlikely that there is any bony or skeletal injury hence reducing the possibility of something permanent. It appears that there is some soft tissue injury in the laryngopharyngeal region or a cartilaginous injury that is resolving very slowly. This indicates an injury closer to the voice box region because of constant movements during speech, laughter and swallowing delay recovery. This may also explain why it is taking so long to heal completely. In my opinion, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is certainly indicated since there has been no improvement in symptoms for five weeks and to look for cartilaginous injury or soft tissue lesions such as a granuloma or hematoma following trauma. In addition, a video laryngoscopy performed by an ENT will help to evaluate the voice box and supporting apparatus internally for any injury (specifically the inter arytenoid region). A hernia in the neck or a laryngocele may be a possibility following neck injury but seems very unlikely in your case since there is no visible bulge in the neck which worsens on coughing, etc. There may be an internal laryngocele that may be picked up on video laryngoscopy. I hope this helps. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! I can understand your concern regarding your symptoms. It is good to know that you had a CT scan and there was no abnormality detected. Persistent pain and pressure in the neck after an injury can occur due to various reasons such as muscle strain, ligament sprain, or herniation of a disc in the neck region. It is less likely to be a hernia as that typically occurs in the abdominal region. \n\nAn MRI scan may be useful for further evaluation of the neck region and to rule out any soft tissue injuries that may not have been detected on a CT scan. I would recommend speaking with your doctor about your concerns and discussing the possibility of an MRI. Additionally, physical therapy may also be beneficial to help alleviate your symptoms and improve your neck function.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1. No need to worry about the neck injury after fall.2. As your CT scan is normal there must be no serious problem in the neck.3. However, if the symptom persists then you can go for MRI of cervical spine to rule out any soft tissue or bony injury.4. Hernia does not occur due to trauma so don't think about it.5. You may consult a neurosurgeon and discuss all these issues. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

My question: I have read that after a certain window period time (three months after getting negative) is conclusive and even after (six months) confirmation is definitely negative. But, why are all these other people saying you can go years without showing positive and that is really freaking me out big time. Is it true that it takes years to come up positive or does it only take six months to know it 100 %? What is true? Also, there is a doctor who says no test is 100 % reliable. I am still 15 months post exposure. HIV RNA PCR qualitative all are negative. 20 months post exposure, HIV-Alere combo test result is negative. Any further test is needed?I am negative now. Will my result change in the future? What is 100 % window period? Please clarify my doubts. Thank you.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. For this question, it is based on the test you do. HIV enters the body on day-0, and goes to the nearest lymph node and starts replication by day-7. This is when, p24 antigens (core proteins of HIV virus) get detected and in turn, the body starts defense and produces HIV antibodies, and these get tested positive in 15 to 23 days. But, due to neutralization of antigens by antibodies, as per theory, testing after 23 days up to 28 days may give false negatives (<0.001%). So, getting a fourth generation HIV test after 28 days is confirmation by 99 %. Yes, not only in medical, but in any field, 100 % is not possible. And taking medico legality, no one gives you 100 % cure. No further test is needed. You are negative by 99.99 %. A change in result is unlikely. You will stay negative forever. The window period is a period where lab tests cannot detect the presence of infection by tests. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nIt is true that HIV has a window period where it may not show up in testing immediately after exposure. The current standard for testing is to get tested three months after exposure, as this will capture the vast majority of cases. However, there have been very rare instances where the window period extends beyond three months. While it is technically possible for it to take years for the virus to become detectable in a test, these rare cases are usually linked to specific factors - for example, people who are immunocompromised or take antiretroviral drugs may have a longer window period. However, these cases are extremely rare and do not represent the typical course of HIV infection.\n\nIn general, if you have a negative test result at six months post-exposure, it is considered conclusive. This is because the overwhelming majority of people will show positive on a test within this timeframe. However, it's always important to get tested regularly if you engage in risky sexual behavior or have other concerns about your HIV status.\n\nDifferent tests have different levels of reliability, but in general, modern tests are very accurate. False negatives may occur if the test is taken too early in the window period or in rare cases with certain types of HIV. However, the possibility of a false negative is extremely low.\n\nGiven that you have had negative HIV RNA PCR qualitative and HIV-Alere combo tests at 15 and 20 months post-exposure, it is highly unlikely that you have HIV. These tests are very sensitive and generally accurate. It's always possible to get retested in the future, but for now, it's safe to assume that you do not have HIV.\n\nIn short, while there is always a small possibility of a false negative, six months is generally considered to be a conclusive window period for HIV testing. The chances of a negative result becoming positive after this timeframe are extremely low.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1. The window period for HIV is from 3 months to 6 months. This means if you were exposed within this period then you will be able to detect HIV antibodies in your blood samples.2. People say that it may take years to develop symptoms of HIV but this is not entirely correct. It may take years before the virus starts replicating at high levels and causes symptoms.3. The Alere Combo test is a combination of HIV antigen and p24 antigens. The HIV antigen is detected earliest and the p24 antigen is detected later. Both tests are combined to get an early detection.4. As your HIV RNA is negative, you do not need any further tests as you are already negative. However, you should continue to practice safe sex and avoid risky sexual behavior."

The thickened tip of the mitral valve leaflet and its prolapse into the left atrium during systole are consistent with this diagnosis. The moderate mitral regurgitation is causing blood to flow backward from the left ventricle into the left atrium during systole, which can lead to left atrial enlargement over time.

        "answer_chatgpt": "Levofloxacin is an antibiotic that is commonly used to prevent infection after dental procedures. The dose prescribed by your dentist is within the recommended range for sinus lift graft surgery and implant placement. However, it is important to note that Levofloxacin has potential side effects, including tendon ruptures, especially in patients over 60 years old or those on steroids, as well as potential for central nervous system stimulation leading to seizures or tremors, which is why it is important to weigh the potential risks vs benefits.\n\nRegarding taking Levofloxacin with Ibuprofen and Dexamethasone, your dentist is likely aware of studies indicating that in general, there is a risk of bleeding when combining certain antibiotics with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen, and may have chosen the combination of medications for a specific reason. However, in this particular scenario, I suggest speaking with the dentist who performed the surgery for a better understanding of why these medications were specifically prescribed.\n\nWhile Levofloxacin is an effective antibiotic, it may not be necessary in all cases or for all patients.

Day by day, it is worsening and my fear is also increasing day by day. I am 19 years old with no bad habit and with a healthy diet and BMI. I used to go to the gym but due to this problem, I am not able to do all my activities. Recently, I had ECG, echo and stress test and blood tests all tests were normal but after 15 minutes of stress test I had chest pain five minutes and sweating for 20 minutes. My resting heart beat has also decreased. I was in anxiety two years back but my ECG at that time was better than this time.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I noted your symptoms and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Frankly, they are all normal. I would like to suggest the following medicines and to see if the problem persists. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Please inform your blood pressure. Good day. For more information consult a cardiologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello, based on your symptoms and the results of your tests, it is important to consider the possibility of a cardiac condition. Even though your ECG, echo and stress test results came back normal, this does not completely rule out the possibility of a cardiac issue. However, there are other conditions that may cause similar symptoms such as anxiety, acid reflux, or musculoskeletal problems. I recommend that you consult with a cardiologist to further evaluate your symptoms and conduct further tests if needed. It is important that you seek medical attention as soon as possible to address your symptoms and prevent any potential complications.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Dear user, Thank you very much for choosing Chat Doctor. I read your question carefully and understand your concern. You should know that chest pain can be caused by many different reasons like musculoskeletal problems, cardiac problems or lung diseases etc. So, if I were your treating physician, I would recommend you to have an x-ray study of the chest and some more specific tests such as: - a chest CT scan-an echocardiography-some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate) for inflammation. The results of these tests will help me to exclude the possible causes of your symptoms and then to prescribe you appropriate treatment. Please do not hesitate to ask if something is not clear. Wish you good health."

        "input": "Hello doctor,My blood pressure is 140/90 since one year and I am using Telmikind 40 tablet in the morning. Today, I visited the cardiologist and he suggested 2D echo and ECG. The reports show mitral valve has AML prolapse and no MR. Kindly clarify this. Is something wrong? I am attaching the reports.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your ECG is normal. In the echo, there is AML (anterior mitral leaflet) prolapse, which means there is slight backward bulging of the valve leaflet. This is mild and there is no leakage in the valve. The risk associated with this is of valve leakage called as mitral regurgitation and it is not there. In most of the individuals, it is benign and does not lead to any complications and some may develop leakages. In you, it less likely to develop leakage as it is not there at present. So, nothing to worry about it now, but get an echo once in three to five years just to keep a check over it. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts. For more information consult a cardiologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello,\n\nThank you for sharing your reports. The findings suggest that you have a mitral valve prolapse, which means that one or both of the mitral valve leaflets in the heart do not close properly, allowing blood to leak back into the left atrium. This condition can cause symptoms such as palpitations, fatigue, chest pain, and shortness of breath, but sometimes people with this condition do not have any symptoms. Mitral valve prolapse is a common condition and it can be managed with medications, lifestyle changes, and periodic monitoring. However, it is important to follow up with your cardiologist to discuss the findings of the 2D echo and ECG and determine whether any treatment is necessary.\n\nRegarding your blood pressure, a reading of 140/90 indicates that you have hypertension, which can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. Telmikind is a medication used to treat hypertension, and it appears that your blood pressure is relatively well-controlled on this medication. However, it is important to continue monitoring your blood pressure and following your cardiologist's recommendations to manage your condition effectively.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, but please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": "1) Your echocardiography report shows that there is a mild leakage of the mitral valve (AMD) which is not causing any clinical symptoms. It is not an indication to get operated now. 2) You may need some medicines for control of BP like telmisartan or losartan etc.3) Get your fasting blood sugar level done as it might be high. 4) Do regular exercise regularly and avoid stress.5) Get a check up from your physician once after 6 months. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. Wishing you good health."

It feels like an electrical pulse is surging up through the back of my head. I also feel dizzy turning side to side and when I get a headache, it feels like it is coming from deep within my left ear. It causes me to panic and get a lot of anxiety afterward. What could this electrical rush sensation be? Then, also, after I get it, I cannot look up too quickly because I feel very dizzy. It usually happens again, while typing on the computer or looking down at a smartphone.",
        "answer_icliniq": "Hello. I will try my level best to help you out. Your symptoms are mostly dizziness, which worsens with sudden eye movements or body movements, and are sometimes associated with headaches. Based on the symptoms, the most common cause in your age group is a vestibular migraine or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). I assume you do not have any other risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke or diagnosis of epilepsy. A simple neurological exam using Dix Hallpike Maneuver can help differentiate between BPPV and vestibular migraine. Also, further questions on the quality of headache, location and associated symptoms such as light sensitivity, loud noise sensitivity and nausea are other important questions, that can happen with vestibular migraine. Treatment for BPPV is physiotherapy with some specific exercises and medicines such as Topiramate or Valproic acid for vestibular migraine. If there are any red flags on neurological exam, then an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain would be needed. Please do not hesitate to ask me any other questions. Take care. For more information consult a neurologist online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! Based on the symptoms you have described, it is possible that you are experiencing a type of migraine called vestibular migraine. This type of migraine can cause sensations of dizziness and electrical shocks in the head. Other symptoms can include sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and vertigo. \n\nIt is important to speak with a healthcare provider to confirm this diagnosis and rule out any other underlying conditions. Treatment for vestibular migraine may include lifestyle changes, medication, and therapy. In the meantime, it may be helpful to take frequent breaks from the computer or smartphone and practice relaxation techniques to manage your anxiety.",
        "answer_chatdoctor": " Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Your symptoms are related to vertigo.

        "answer_icliniq": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I just read your query about mouth breathing. I would like to say that yes, eventually it causes enlarged tonsils as well as adenoids, and causes a nasal obstruction leading to obstructive sleep apnea. It can happen in any body type. If your nose is blocked because of nasal polyps or a hypertrophic nasal mucosa leading you to breathe through your mouth, then you must visit an ENT (ear, nose. and throat) specialist to correct the issue. Hope you find my advice of some benefit. Good luck. For more information consult a general practitioner online ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! Mouth breathing during sleep can be harmful as it can dry out the mouth and throat, leading to a sore throat and increased risk of infections. Additionally, mouth breathing can lead to dental problems such as cavities and gum disease. \n\nIf you are not experiencing any other symptoms such as snoring or daytime sleepiness, it is unlikely that you will develop sleep apnea solely due to mouth breathing during sleep. However, if you are concerned about your breathing during sleep, I recommend speaking to a healthcare provider who can evaluate you further and provide guidance on how to optimize your breathing during sleep.",

        "input": "Hello doctor,My dear daughter just completed 1 year yesterday and still on breastfeed (twice, a full day) along with normal food. She is lactose intolerant and was hypocalcemic (less calcium) by birth. Her doctor gave her OstoCalcium and retested after six months and she turned to be absolutely fine with calcium levels and other reports. The doctor advised going off the medicine.Now the complaint is; from last Friday, she was vomiting frequently three times. She was on breastfeed and her mother was having super acidity. On Saturday, we did not make her consume breastmilk and she was fine. On Sunday, we went for a wedding and while to and fro in the car she was vomiting.After that, there was no vomiting. She is very active but very restless (like throwing anything in hand, continuously trying to chew something specifically her own finger and looking to drink water more than normal, suddenly crying and then stops and starts behaving normally).Today, she did watery potty twice and we have her Peditrol ORS. What can be the issue? Please suggest, we are perplexed as the symptoms keep on changing each time. Is she teething?",

Consult your child\\s specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. ",
        "answer_chatgpt": "Hello! I understand your concern about your daughter's symptoms.\n\nThe vomiting could be due to the acidity in her mother's breastmilk, as you mentioned. It's important for your daughter's mother to avoid foods that may increase acidity in her breastmilk, such as spicy or fried foods.\n\nIt's good that you stopped giving her breastmilk on Saturday and that she hasn't vomited since then. However, the fact that she had watery potty twice today is concerning. This could be due to a stomach infection or could be related to the vomiting she had earlier.\n\nIf this continues, I would suggest taking her to her pediatrician. The pediatrician will be able to determine if there is an underlying condition or infection that needs treatment. It's also possible that your daughter is teething, but this would not explain the vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure to give her plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration, such as the Peditrol ORS you've been giving her. Keep an eye on her symptoms and if they persist, seek medical attention.",

It is possible that this could be an allergic reaction to the formula milk she is taking or to the food eaten at the wedding.3. This is also common during teething where babies become fussy due to discomfort caused by the increasing teeth.4. You should give her plenty of fluids and let her sleep if she gets tired easily.5. If the symptoms persist, consult your pediatrician. Hope this helps."
